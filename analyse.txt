While @@CITATION established a foundational framework for analyzing polycentric governance systems, our research extends this methodology by incorporating a dynamic network analysis to track the evolution of policy learning and coordination over a 20-year period in three major river basins.\n2.  This paper builds upon the multi-level perspective (MLP) on socio-technical transitions pioneered by @@CITATION by applying it to a novel dataset of policy instruments across 50 states to quantitatively test the conditions under which niche innovations break through into the mainstream regime.\n3.  To address the limitations of static economic models, our analysis extends the integrated assessment model developed by @@CITATION through the incorporation of adaptive agent-based modeling, allowing us to simulate non-linear behavioral responses to carbon pricing policies.\n4.  Our work significantly extends the data presented in @@CITATION by moving from a single-case study to a large-N comparative analysis, compiling a new longitudinal dataset of 150 environmental conflicts to statistically assess the factors leading to successful community resistance against extractive projects.\n5.  We extend the conceptualization of social-ecological systems (SES) resilience found in @@CITATION by integrating a justice-oriented framework, thereby evaluating how resilience-building policies differentially impact vulnerable and marginalized populations.\n6.

While current models can predict drug response from bulk genomic data, future work must focus on incorporating single-cell resolution to account for tumor heterogeneity, a critical gap highlighted by the foundational work of @@CITATION.\n\n2.  The integration of high-throughput metabolomics data with constraint-based models, as pioneered by @@CITATION, provides a blueprint, but a key future challenge is dynamically reconciling these snapshots with regulatory networks to predict metabolic state transitions.\n\n3.  Recent advances in spatial transcriptomics, exemplified by @@CITATION, have beautifully mapped cellular neighborhoods, yet a major future direction is the development of computational methods to infer directed cell-cell communication fluxes within these microenvironments.\n\n4.  While deep learning models like those from @@CITATION have shown remarkable success in predicting protein-protein interactions from sequence alone, a critical next step is to integrate these predictions with context-specific expression data to build condition-specific interactomes.\n\n5.  The concept of digital twins in healthcare, as proposed by @@CITATION, is incredibly promising; future work must therefore establish robust pipelines for generating patient-specific multi-omic models that can be dynamically updated with real-time clinical data.\n\n6.  To move beyond static associations, future models of gene regulation need to incorporate the dynamic principles of chromatin state and 3D architecture, building upon the seminal mapping efforts of consortia like @@CITATION.\n\n7.  The application of causal machine learning techniques, as explored in a different context by @@CITATION, offers a powerful future framework for moving from correlative multi-omic analyses to the discovery of therapeutic intervention points in complex diseases.\n\n8.  A significant limitation of current kinetic models is their reliance on *in vitro* parameters; a crucial future avenue, building on the parameter estimation methods of @@CITATION, is the development of approaches to infer these values directly from *in vivo* omics data.\n\n9.  The successful use of natural language processing to structure biomedical knowledge, demonstrated by @@CITATION, should be extended as a future work to automatically convert findings from the literature into executable logic rules for large-scale mechanistic models.\n\n10.
