Political Geography might involve topics like electoral geography, border studies, geopolitics, spatial analysis, GIS, etc. So, I should think of common data sources, methods, or tools used in this field.\\n\\nPossible elements to cite:\\n\\n- Datasets: e.g., electoral data, census data, conflict data.\\n\\n- Methods: e.g., spatial regression, GIS analysis, qualitative methods.\\n\\n- Software: e.g., ArcGIS, QGIS, R packages for spatial analysis.\\n\\n- Theoretical frameworks: e.g., from key authors in political geography.\\n\\nI need 10 sentences. Each should end with ( @@CITATION ) or have @@CITATION embedded appropriately.\\n\\nLet me brainstorm some ideas:\\n\\n1. Using a specific dataset, like World Bank data or UN data.\\n\\n2. Applying a method from a famous political geographer.\\n\\n3. Using software or tool for mapping.\\n\\n4. Referencing a standard textbook or paper for a concept.\\n\\n5.

Using a algorithm for spatial clustering.\\n\\nI should make sure the sentences are coherent and sound like they\\'re from a research context.\\n\\nNow, let\\'s write 10 sentences one by one.\\n\\nSentence 1: Perhaps about using GIS software.\\n\\n\"Spatial analysis was conducted using ArcGIS software ( @@CITATION ).\"\\n\\nBut that might be too simple. Looking at examples, they often have more detail.\\n\\nBetter: \"We performed spatial autocorrelation analysis using the methods described in ( @@CITATION ).\"\\n\\nOr: \"The electoral districts were mapped using QGIS, following the protocol outlined by @@CITATION.\"\\n\\nSentence 2: Using a dataset.\\n\\n\"Population data were obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau ( @@CITATION ).\"\\n\\nBut in the examples, sometimes the citation is for the method or the source.

I can use parentheses or not, as long as it\\'s at the end or appropriately placed.\\n\\nIn the instruction, it says \"written as @@CITATION and be in the end of the sentence\". But in examples, it\\'s not always strictly at the end; for instance, in \"We use the agreement checker code developed by @@CITATION and evaluate our baseline...\", the citation is in the middle, but the sentence continues. However, the instruction says \"be in the end of the sentence\", but looking at the examples, some sentences have the citation not at the very end. Let\\'s check.\\n\\nIn the first example: \"This was done by MERT optimization ( @@CITATION ) towards post-edits under the TER target metric .\" Here, ( @@CITATION ) is before \"towards\", so not end.\\n\\nSecond example: \"We use the agreement checker code developed by @@CITATION and evaluate our baseline...\" Citation is before \"and\".\\n\\nThird: \"Similar to our previous work ( Chan and Ng , 2005b ) , we used the supervised WSD approach described in ( @@CITATION ) for our experiments...\" Citation is before \"for\".\\n\\nFourth: \"transition-based dependency parsing framework ( @@CITATION ) using an arc-eager transition strategy...\" Citation is before \"using\".\\n\\nFifth: \"each relevant document is retrieved ( @@CITATION ).\" This one ends with citation.\\n\\nSixth: \"The system utilizes several large size biological databases including three NCBI databases ( GenPept [ 11 ] , RefSeq @@CITATION , and Entrez GENE [ 13 ] )...\" Citation is in the middle of a list.\\n\\nSeventh: \"The LM uses the monolingual data and is trained as a five-gram9 using the SRILM-Toolkit ( @@CITATION ).\" Ends with citation.\\n\\nEighth: \"in history-based models ( @@CITATION ), the probability estimate...\" Citation is after the subject.\\n\\nNinth: \"The first is the one used in the chunking competition in CoNLL-2000 ( Tjong Kim @@CITATION ).\" Ends with citation.\\n\\nTenth: \"The ten most specific nouns have been produced by comparing our corpus of computing to the French corpus Le Monde , composed of newspaper articles ( @@CITATION ).\" Ends with citation.\\n\\nSo, it\\'s not strictly that the citation must be at the very end; it can be part of the sentence structure. But the instruction says \"be in the end of the sentence\", which might be misinterpreted. Looking at the examples, it\\'s often at the end of a clause or phrase. I think I should follow the pattern where the citation is placed where it naturally fits, but typically towards the end of the relevant part.\\n\\nTo be safe, I\\'ll make sure that in each sentence, the @@CITATION is placed where it indicates the source of what is being used, and it can be at the end or embedded.\\n\\nNow, for my task, I need 10 citations for Political Geography.\\n\\nLet me list out 10 sentences:\\n\\n1.

Referencing a standard text: \"The classification of border types was informed by the typology presented in @@CITATION.\"\\n\\nI need to make sure these sound academic and fit Political Geography.\\n\\nAlso, the citation should be @@CITATION, which might represent a specific author or work. In the examples, sometimes it\\'s like \"Tjong Kim @@CITATION\", which might be a name. So, I can include author names if it makes sense, but the placeholder is @@CITATION.\\n\\nIn the examples, when it\\'s \"developed by @@CITATION\", it might be implying the citation is for the developer. Similarly, \"described in ( @@CITATION )\" etc.\\n\\nI should vary the structures like in the examples.\\n\\nLet me refine my sentences to match the style.\\n\\nFinalize 10 sentences:\\n\\n1. \"Spatial autocorrelation was measured using Moran\\'s I statistic as implemented in the spdep package in R ( @@CITATION ).\"\\n\\n2. \"We obtained demographic data from the World Bank\\'s World Development Indicators ( @@CITATION ).\"\\n\\n3. \"The analysis of electoral geography was guided by the theoretical perspectives in @@CITATION.\"\\n\\n4. \"Geographic Information Systems (GIS) were used for mapping conflict zones, following the protocols established by @@CITATION.\"\\n\\n5. \"A multilevel model was fitted to account for nested data structures, using the approach detailed in @@CITATION.\"\\n\\n6. \"Text data from political speeches were analyzed using content analysis methods adapted from @@CITATION.\"\\n\\n7. \"The calculation of accessibility indices was performed with the Accessibility Toolbox for GIS ( @@CITATION ).\"\\n\\n8. \"Case studies were selected based on the criteria outlined in the seminal work of @@CITATION.\"\\n\\n9. \"Network analysis of international relations was conducted using the software UCINet ( @@CITATION ).\"\\n\\n10. \"The definition of \\'territorial dispute\\' was operationalized according to the coding scheme in @@CITATION.\"\\n\\nThese seem appropriate.
