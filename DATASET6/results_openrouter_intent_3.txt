Looking at the provided examples, I notice they often reference prior work to justify choices or build upon existing research. I should structure the citations to mirror this pattern—using phrases like "Building on," "Extending," or "Motivated by" to link the citation to the research motivation. 

The topics should align with algorithms and complexity, so I'll focus on areas like approximation algorithms, online algorithms, graph theory, and machine learning theory.

OK, the user wants me to generate citations in the style of economic sociology, specifically for motivation purposes. Let me break down what they need.

First, the citations should illustrate the need for data, goals, methods, etc., and each must include @@CITATION in the middle of a sentence. The examples provided mix different ways to cite, some with author names or years, others just the placeholder. I should follow that pattern but keep it varied.

Hmm, economic sociology focuses on how economic processes are embedded in social structures. So the citations need to reflect that intersection. Maybe start by thinking about classic and recent studies that highlight data-driven arguments or methodological innovations.

Granovetter's embeddedness theory is a cornerstone here. Using that would ground the citations in a well-known framework. Also, considering newer works like Zuboff's surveillance capitalism could show relevance to contemporary issues. 

I need to ensure each citation serves a clear motivational purpose: justifying data collection, method choice, or theoretical framing. For example, citing DiMaggio and Powell to explain organizational isomorphism makes sense for methodological motivation. 

Including a mix of authors and studies will show breadth. Some citations should reference specific findings (like Autor et al. on labor markets), while others might highlight theoretical needs (e.g., Fligstein's field theory). 

Wait, should I use actual author names or keep it generic? The examples sometimes include names, so it's okay to mix. But the placeholder @@CITATION must be there. Maybe alternate between named and unnamed citations to mimic the examples.

Also, check that each sentence structure places @@CITATION naturally within the flow, not at the start or end. Ensure diversity in the verbs used: "draws on", "builds upon", "relies on", etc., to avoid repetition.

Finally, review each citation to ensure it aligns with economic sociology themes and clearly motivates the aspect (data, method, theory) as intended.Of course.

Hmm, the user wants 10 citations in a specific format that illustrate motivations related to data, goals, and methods in the philosophy of science. The citations should be embedded in the middle of sentences using @@CITATION. The examples provided show a pattern where the citation supports a methodological choice, builds on prior work, or justifies a research direction.

I should focus on creating sentences that explicitly mention why the cited work is relevant—whether it’s about data collection, theoretical framing, methodological rigor, or problem selection. The citations should feel natural within the sentence, not just tacked on at the end. 

I’ll draw from well-known philosophers of science (e.g., Kuhn, Popper, Lakatos) and contemporary debates (e.g., reproducibility crisis, feminist epistemology) to ensure the citations are meaningful. Each sentence should clearly state how the cited work motivates the current approach, like justifying a data type or critiquing a method. 

Also, I’ll vary the structures slightly to avoid repetition—sometimes the citation comes before the rationale, sometimes after. The key is to make it flow like a researcher explaining their thoughtOf course.

I should ensure diversity in the topics to cover different facets of the field. The citations must sound authentic, like they're from real studies, so I'll use technical terms and specific scenarios common in anesthesiology literature.
