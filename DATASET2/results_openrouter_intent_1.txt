Of course. As a Conservation Biology researcher, here are 10 citations written in the requested "USES" format, reflecting common practices in the field.

1.  @@CITATION We used the spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) methods to estimate jaguar population density across the fragmented landscape.
2.  @@CITATION To analyze the long-term trends in African elephant poaching pressure, we applied the MIKE (Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants) data standards and protocols.
3.  @@CITATION We conducted a habitat suitability analysis for the northern spotted owl using the MaxEnt software package with climate and vegetation variables.
4.  @@CITATION Following the recommended standards for reporting plant reintroduction efforts, we documented the survival and flowering rates of the reintroduced population over a five-year period.
5.  @@CITATION To assess the genetic diversity and inbreeding levels in the isolated wolf population, we employed the methods for estimating effective population size (Ne) from genomic data.
6.  @@CITATION We calculated the IUCN Red List categories and criteria for the newly assessed amphibian species to determine their threat status.
7.  @@CITATION The global protected area network was analyzed using the World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) to identify critical gaps in representation for freshwater ecoregions.
8.  @@CITATION We implemented the camera trap data management and analysis pipeline to process over one million images and identify species using machine learning algorithms.
9.  @@CITATION To parameterize our population viability analysis (PVA) model for the black rhino meta-population, we used the published vital rates and demographic stochasticity estimates.
10. @@CITATION The acoustic data from our forest monitoring arrays were processed and species calls were identified using the deep learning framework for automated avian bioacoustics.
