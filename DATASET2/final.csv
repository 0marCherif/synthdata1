4,"Of course. As a PhD student in Economic Sociology, I would argue that understanding economic action requires a foundational grasp of its social embeddedness, a concept famously articulated by @@CITATION (Granovetter 1985), which posits that economic behaviors are deeply enmeshed in networks of social relations. This perspective challenges the neoclassical view of the atomized actor by showing how social structures, particularly networks @@CITATION (Granovetter 2005), create trust, disseminate information, and shape opportunities in markets. Furthermore, the very emergence of the market economy was not a natural occurrence but a political project, a process of disembedding and re-embedding described in the seminal work on the great transformation by @@CITATION (Polanyi 1944). Within these constructed markets, actors compete not only for economic capital but also for symbolic power, a form of capital analyzed through the lens of field theory by @@CITATION (Bourdieu 2005). The stability of these fields often relies on shared cognitive frameworks, or institutional logics @@CITATION (Thornton, Ocasio, and Lounsbury 2012), which provide the rules of the game that guide and legitimize action.

The actors who skillfully navigate these pressures to create new institutions or transform existing ones are known as institutional entrepreneurs @@CITATION (Fligstein 2001), whose strategies are crucial for understanding market formation and change. This entrepreneurial action is often directed towards achieving a form of stable social order, or what has been termed a conception of control @@CITATION (Fligstein 1990), which dominates a given market field. The valuation of goods within these fields is also a profoundly social process, as shown in the research on valuation and worth @@CITATION (Boltanski and Th�venot 2006), which demonstrates how multiple orders of justification are mobilized to determine value.
