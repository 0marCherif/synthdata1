Here are 10 citations expressing similarity or difference to Granovetter's work:

1.  While Granovetter correctly established that economic action is embedded in social networks, his framework under-theorizes the role of power and hierarchy within those very networks, a gap addressed by @@CITATION (Padgett & Powell, 2012).
2.  The critique of the under-socialized *homo economicus* model is furthered by studies showing how shared cultural understandings and categories, not just interpersonal ties, structure markets, as detailed in @@CITATION (Zelizer, 2010).

4.  Extending the logic of embeddedness into the digital age, recent scholarship examines how online platforms create new forms of social infrastructure that facilitate economic exchange, a phenomenon explored in @@CITATION (Fourcade & Kluttz, 2020).
5.  Whereas Granovetter emphasized how social ties enable economic action, a contrasting view argues that certain strong ties, such as those in tightly-knit communities, can actually hinder market development through excessive claims and obligations, a paradox presented in @@CITATION (Portes, 1998).
6.  The performativity thesis, which posits that economic theories (like neoclassical models) can shape the realities they purport to describe, offers a distinct mechanism of embeddedness through discourse and calculation, as argued in @@CITATION (MacKenzie, 2006).
7.  Similar to Granovetter's argument against atomized actors, research on moral economies demonstrates that economic behavior is often governed by deeply held ethical beliefs and notions of justice, not just calculative interest, a theme central to @@CITATION (Sayer, 2000).
8.  A crucial difference emerges when considering that social networks can be used for explicitly anti-economic or destructive purposes, such as in the operation of illicit markets, a domain where the Granovetterian framework is critically applied in @@CITATION (Beckert & Dewey, 2021).
9.  The concept of embeddedness finds a strong parallel in Bourdieu's theory of practice, which argues that economic dispositions are ingrained through habitus and that capital exists in multiple social forms, a comprehensive framework laid out in @@CITATION (Bourdieu, 2005).
10. Moving beyond a primarily sociological analysis, a contrasting interdisciplinary approach seeks to integrate the role of cognitive biases and heuristics from behavioral economics into the study of how social contexts shape economic decisions, a synthesis attempted in @@CITATION (Guseva & Rona-Tas, 2021).

7.  Extending the preliminary work on a machine learning-driven early warning system for in-hospital deterioration @@CITATION, our current algorithm now integrates real-time data from wireless wearable sensors to improve predictive accuracy.
8.  The current trial utilizes a next-generation, non-viral vector for gene therapy in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, aiming to overcome the immunogenic limitations observed in the seminal first-in-human study @@CITATION.
9.  Our research group has developed a more comprehensive and automated framework for analyzing speckle-tracking echocardiography data, addressing the significant inter-observer variability noted as a key limitation in @@CITATION.
10. This prospective study seeks to confirm the provocative hypothesis generated by the multi-omics analysis in @@CITATION by directly measuring the proposed causal pathway linking gut microbiome metabolites to myocardial fibrosis in a dedicated interventional cohort.
