Future studies should analyze the visual rhetoric of algorithmic bias in facial recognition systems and its disproportionate impact on marginalized communities, a critical task outlined by @@CITATION.\\n8.  We must develop sensory ethnography methodologies that can effectively archive and analyze the rapidly evolving visual culture of digital games and virtual worlds, drawing on the framework established by @@CITATION.\\n9.  The role of amateur vernacular photography on platforms like Instagram in shaping transnational migrant identities presents a rich area for future comparative research, as suggested by @@CITATION.\\n10. Anthropological analysis of AI-generated imagery is crucial to understand how synthetic visual media shapes and is shaped by cultural stereotypes and social narratives, a new frontier explored by @@CITATION.', 'refusal': None, 'reasoning': 'Hmm, the user is asking me to generate 10 citations in the style of future work references from a Visual Anthropology perspective. The examples provided show a pattern: each citation is embedded in a sentence discussing potential research directions, ending with @@CITATION. \\n\\nI need to craft sentences that suggest avenues for future research while naturally incorporating the placeholder citation. The topics should align with Visual Anthropology, covering areas like digital ethnography, sensory media, decolonial approaches, and emerging technologies. \\n\\nEach sentence should be substantive, pointing to a specific research gap or methodological innovation. The citations should feel organic, like they’re referencing existing or hypothetical works that could fill those gaps. I’ll vary the phrasing to avoid repetition, using constructs like \"as explored by,\" \"following the lead of,\" or \"drawing on methodologies from.\" \\n\\nThe goal is to make each entry sound like a genuine scholarly suggestion while strictly adhering to the @@CITATION format at the end.'}}], 'usage': {'prompt_tokens': 388, 'completion_tokens': 623, 'total_tokens': 1011, 'prompt_tokens_details': None}}\n"
