The word \"similar\" is used, but it\\'s not comparing the current work to the cited ones; it\\'s stating that the cited works had similar findings. So it\\'s more about aligning with existing research rather than contrasting.\\n\\n3: MOTIVATION - This is about illustrating a need for the current study.

The author isn\\'t building upon these studies; they\\'re just referencing them as prior evidence.\\n\\n5: FUTURE - This is for suggesting future work, which isn\\'t the case here.\\n\\nSo, the main point is that the citations are used to show that previous research supports the same observation.

Let me go through the intent categories one by one. \\n\\n**Background**: If the citation is there to provide foundational knowledge or context for the current study, that\\'s a Background intent.

So maybe it\\'s setting the stage for their own work by showing existing methods. \\n\\n**Motivation**: This would apply if the author is pointing out a gap or need that their paper addresses. For example, if they said something like, \"Previous methods have limitations, so our work comes in to solve that.\" But in this case, they\\'re just describing what others have done without indicating a problem they\\'re addressing. So Motivation might not fit here. \\n\\n**Uses**: This is when the current paper directly uses data or methods from the cited work. The sentence doesn\\'t mention the current author\\'s work using any of these methods. Instead, it\\'s just referencing that others have done this. So Uses probably isn\\'t it. \\n\\n**Continuation** (Extends): This is for when the author\\'s work builds on or extends the cited research.

Future would suggest the cited work is a direction for further research.\\n\\nLooking at the sentence, the author references the \\'Nitrogen\\' generator\\'s method.

Specifically, they added a constraint to handle dependency length in parsing. The phrase \"using a scheme they call structural annealing\" indicates that Smith and Eisner introduced this method. \\n\\nNow, breaking down the intent options:\\n\\n- **Background (0)**: If the citation is providing general domain info, but here it\\'s specific to a method.  \\n- **Motivation (3)**: If they\\'re explaining why the research is needed.

The authors of this sentence are referencing that work to either provide background or to use it in their method. \\n\\nConsidering that the citation introduces a prior idea to explain how it\\'s applied or to provide context, it matches **Background (0)** more. The text sets the scene by explaining prior work (Smith & Eisner) to contextualize this study\\'s domain. \\n\\nFinal decision: The authors are using Smith & Eisner\\'s work to lay foundational knowledge necessary for their current study.

If they\\'re using Blum and Chawla\\'s methods as a basis for their own framework, that points to \"Uses.\" The integration of perspectives from that citation into their framework indicates they\\'re employing the methods from the cited work.\\n- **CONTINUATION (Extends)**: If the authors are extending the cited work\\'s data or methods, that would be Continuation. The example says \"extends the citation\\'s data, methods, etc.\" However, the text here says \"inspired by\" and integrates both perspectives. While there might be an extension implied since they\\'re applying it to speech segments, the primary focus is that they\\'re using the methods from the citation to create their framework. So it\\'s more about using existing methods rather than building upon them to create something new.\\n- **COMPARE OR CONTRASTS**: If they\\'re highlighting similarities or differences to the cited work. The text doesn\\'t indicate any comparison; it simply states inspiration without contrasting methods or results.\\n- **FUTURE**: Suggests future work based on the citation. The text is about the current framework, not future plans.\\n\\nLooking at the key phrases: \"directly inspired by\" and \"integrates both perspectives\" from Blum and Chawla. This indicates that the authors are using the methods or ideas from the cited paper to develop their own framework. That points to the \"USES\" category, which is about using data, methods, etc., from the citation. They\\'re utilizing the approach from Blum and Chawla\\'s work as a foundation for their current model. Even though they might be extending it (as in applying it to speech segments), the core intent here is to use the cited work\\'s methodology. Hence, the correct classification is \"USES\".\\n',\n",

The options given are Background, Motivation, Uses, Continuation, Compares or Contrasts, Future, and Other. I need to classify the citation based on these intents. \\n\\nFirst, I\\'ll read the citation carefully: \"The bottom panel of table 1 lists the results for the chosen lexicalized model ( SSN-Freq > 200 ) and five recent statistical parsers ( Ratnaparkhi , 1999 ; Collins , 1999 ; Charniak , 2000 ; Collins , 2000 ; Bod , 2001 ).\" \\n\\nOkay, so in this sentence, the author is referring to table 1, which shows results from a specific model and lists several statistical parsers along with their publication years. The parsers mentioned are by Ratnaparkhi (1999), Collins (1999), Charniak (2000), Collins (2000), and Bod (2001).\\n\\nNow, I\\'ll go through each possible intent to see which fits best. \\n\\nStarting with Background: This is when a citation provides relevant domain information. Is that what\\'s happening here? The author is presenting existing models and parsers. It seems like they\\'re setting the context by referring to previous work, which could fall under Background.\\n\\nNext, Motivation: This would be if the citation is used to justify the need for the current study. Does the author explain why these parsers are important for their research? The sentence seems more factual than motivational, just listing the parsers without explaining their necessity, so probably not Motivation.\\n\\nUses: This intent is when the current work applies data or methods from the cited work. Is the author saying they used these parsers? The sentence states that table 1 lists results, but it doesn\\'t explicitly say that the author used these parsers in their own study. So, it doesn\\'t seem like Uses applies here.\\n\\nContinuation: This is when the current work extends or builds upon the cited work. Is the author suggesting their work is a continuation? The citation is just listing prior work without any indication that the current study is building on it. So, probably not Continuation.\\n\\nCompares or Contrasts: Would the author be comparing or contrasting their work with these parsers? The sentence just lists them without any explicit comparison or contrast. So, this isn\\'t it either.\\n\\nFuture: This would be if the citation points to potential future research directions. The text here is about current or past work, not future possibilities, so that\\'s out.\\n\\nOther: I should consider if none of the above fits. But given that the citations are providing context, Background seems more appropriate.\\n\\nSo, coming back to Background, the mention of previous parsers in table 1 seems to serve as backdrop information. The author is laying the groundwork by referencing established models and parsers. Therefore, the intent is to provide relevant domain context, which aligns with Background.\\n'}}],\n",

So, the user provides a specific citation context: \"This imbalance foils thresholding strategies , clever as they might be (Gale & Church , 1991 ; Wu & Xia , 1994 ; Chen , 1996).\" \\n\\nFirst, I need to understand what the sentence is saying. The phrase \"this imbalance foils thresholding strategies\" suggests that there\\'s some kind of imbalance that\\'s causing thresholding strategies to fail, even if those strategies are considered clever. Then, there are three references cited: Gale & Church (1991), Wu & Xia (1994), and Chen (1996). \\n\\nNow, the task is to figure out why these specific papers are being cited here. Going through the possible intents:\\n\\n1. **BACKGROUND**: If the citation is just providing general domain knowledge or foundational info, that\\'d be Background. Here, that doesn\\'t seem to fit because the focus is on how prior strategies fail.\\n\\n2. **USES**: This is when the current work uses data or methods from the cited work. The sentence doesn’t indicate the present authors using those older methods; rather, they’re pointing out flaws.\\n\\n3. **COMPARES OR CONTRASTS**: If the citation highlights similarities or differences. But here, the authors aren\\'t comparing; they’re stating that those methods fail.\\n\\n4. **MOTIVATION**: If the citation explains the need for the current work—like highlighting a gap or problem. That feels plausible here because the \"imbalance foils\" existing methods, suggesting that the cited approaches don’t solve the problem and thus motivate the authors\\' new approach.\\n\\n5. **CONTINUATION** (Extends): This would apply if the current work builds directly on the cited papers\\' methods/data. The phrase here doesn’t suggest extension; it’s critical of prior work.\\n\\n6. **FUTURE**: Mentions the citation as a direction for future work, which doesn’t fit.\\n\\nSo, the key is recognizing that the authors are using previous studies (Gale et al., Wu et al., Chen) as examples of strategies that failed due to an imbalance. That frames prior works as insufficient and thus *motivates* the current solution. Hence intent 3: MOTIVATION. \\n\\nFinal check: The imbalance undermining existing strategies directly justifies why the authors\\' approach is needed. That’s classic motivation framing.\\n'}}],\n",

The key action here is \"employed,\" which means they used a tool or method developed by others.\\n\\nNow, categorizing the intent: Since they\\'re directly applying the ROUGE tool in their own work, that seems like they\\'re \"using\" it.

Background is for providing domain information, like when citing foundational studies. Here, they\\'re not just describing the domain; they\\'re actively using a tool. Motivation? That\\'s for illustrating a need, which isn\\'t the case—it\\'s about application.

Compares or Contrasts involves similarity or differences; they noted similarity in results, but that\\'s secondary—the main point is about employing the tool.

The author mentions that previously, in Gerber and Chai 2010, they assessed the importance of implicit argument features using ablation tests. The key part here is that the citation refers to their own prior work. The phrase \"Previously\" indicates that this is referencing past research done by the same team. \\n\\nNow, considering the categories: \\n- **BACKGROUND**: This would be if the citation provides foundational knowledge or context for the current study. \\n- **USES**: If the current work applies methods or data from the cited work.\\n- **CONTINUATION/EXTENDS**: If the current work builds upon or extends the cited work.\\n- **MOTIVATION**: If the citation highlights a problem or need that motivates the current research.\\n- **COMPARES OR CONTRASTS**: If the author is comparing their work with the cited one.\\n- **FUTURE**: If the citation suggests directions for future research.\\n\\nIn this case, the author is referencing their own previous study where they conducted ablation tests. The current paper likely builds on that work, extending it further. The use of \"we assessed\" indicates continuity from the prior study. Therefore, the intent is to show that the current work is an extension of Gerber and Chai 2010.

Each intent has a specific definition, and I need to map the citation to one of these categories.\\n\\nFirst, I\\'ll look at the citation text: \"We present experiments on the two standard coreference resolution datasets, ACE-2004 (NIST, 2004) and OntoNotes-5.0 (Hovy et al., 2006).\" \\n\\nBreaking this down, the sentence mentions that the authors are presenting experiments using two datasets: ACE-2004 and OntoNotes-5.0.

Are they motivating the current work? Or are they being extended?\\n\\nLooking at the definitions:\\n\\n- **BACKGROUND**: Providing relevant information for the domain. This would be if the citation is giving context or foundational knowledge.\\n- **USES**: Using data, methods, etc., from the citation. This seems relevant here because the authors are mentioning datasets that they used in their experiments.\\n- **EXTENDS**: Extending the citation\\'s data or methods. There\\'s no indication here that the authors are building upon or extending the cited works; they\\'re just using the datasets.\\n- **MOTIVATION**: Illustrating a need for data, goals, methods. The sentence doesn\\'t suggest that the citations are highlighting a gap or motivating the current study.\\n- **COMPARES OR CONTRASTS**: Expressing similarities or differences. The text doesn\\'t compare or contrast with the cited works; it simply states the use of datasets.\\n- **FUTURE**: Pointing to future work. This isn\\'t mentioned in the sentence.\\n\\nGiven that the authors are explicitly stating they used these datasets for their experiments, the intent aligns with **USES**. They\\'re leveraging existing datasets (ACE-2004 and OntoNotes-5.0) for their own work. Therefore, the correct classification is **USES**, which corresponds to number **1**.\\n'}}],\n",

It attributes this to Goodman (1996). This seems like the author is referring to a method or a result from Goodman\\'s work.\\n\\nBreaking it down:\\n- \"subderivations headed by A1 with external nonterminals only at the leaves, internal nonterminals elsewhere\" – this sounds like a technical description from computational linguistics or grammar systems, probably related to parsing or formal grammars.\\n- \"have probability 1/a1\" – this specifies a probabilistic aspect.\\n- The citation \"(Goodman 1996)\" indicates that this concept or result comes from that source.\\n\\nNow, to classify the intent:\\n- Is this providing background information? BACKGROUND (0) is for giving relevant domain context. This could be background if it\\'s setting up foundational knowledge for the current paper.\\n- Motivation (3) is about illustrating a need, like why something is important or why the research is done. This sentence doesn\\'t seem to express a need; it\\'s stating a fact.\\n- Uses (1) is when the current work uses data, methods, etc., from the citation. Here, it might be using a method or formula from Goodman, so USES could fit.\\n- Continuation (4) is when the current work extends the cited work. This sentence is describing what Goodman said; it doesn\\'t say that the current work is building on it or extending it. It\\'s just referencing a result.\\n- Compares or contrasts (2) involves expressing similarity or difference. This sentence isn\\'t comparing anything; it\\'s attributing a statement directly.\\n- Future (5) is about suggesting future work. Not applicable here.\\n\\nThe key part is that the author is using a specific probability from Goodman (1996).

In the context of the paper, this could be part of describing the methodology that the author is using. Therefore, it might be that the author is using Goodman\\'s approach.\\n\\nBut the citation is just attributed at the end, suggesting that this is a standard or established result from Goodman that the current paper relies on or utilizes.\\n\\nConsidering the categories:\\n- If the author is using this as part of their method, then USES (1) makes sense.\\n- If this is just informing the reader about prior work for context, it could be BACKGROUND (0).\\n\\nHowever, the way it\\'s phrased, it\\'s not just providing background; it\\'s specifying a technical detail that\\'s likely integral to the paper\\'s own methods. So, USES seems more appropriate.\\n\\nThere\\'s no indication of extension, comparison, motivation, or future work.\\n\\nI recall that in citation classification, USES often refers to when a paper applies a method, tool, or data from another work directly.\\n\\nFor instance, if the paper is using a formula, algorithm, or concept from Goodman, it falls under USES.\\n\\nBACKGROUND would be more for general references to establish the field or related work without necessarily using it directly.\\n\\nHere, since it\\'s a specific probabilistic statement attributed to Goodman, it\\'s being used in the current context.\\n\\nTherefore, I think the intent is USES, which corresponds to number 1.'}}],\n",

The references serve as authoritative sources for standard syntactic approaches. Classic BACKGROUND usage to situate the research context.\\n\\n*double-checks notes*\\nYes, BACKGROUND intent is for citations that \"provide relevant information for this domain.\" Perfect match.
