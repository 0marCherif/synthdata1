### Citation Rewrites with Different Scientific Domains:

1. **Genomics**:  
   This choice is motivated by an observation we made previously ( @@CITATIONa ): since each gene in a pathway influences the expression of subsequent genes, we could exploit their dependencies by modeling their regulatory interactions together. As our pathway analyzer, we employ a Bayesian network model (Pearl, 1988).
