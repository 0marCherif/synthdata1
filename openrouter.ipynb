While Granovetter correctly established that economic action is embedded in social networks, his framework under-theorizes the role of power and hierarchy within those very networks, a gap addressed by @@CITATION (Padgett & Powell, 2012).\\n2.  The critique of the under-socialized *homo economicus* model is furthered by studies showing how shared cultural understandings and categories, not just interpersonal ties, structure markets, as detailed in @@CITATION (Zelizer, 2010).\\n3.  In direct contrast to Granovetter's focus on the meso-level of networks, a more macro-institutional approach argues that economies are embedded in and shaped by overarching political and legal structures, a point central to @@CITATION (Fligstein, 2001).\\n4.  Extending the logic of embeddedness into the digital age, recent scholarship examines how online platforms create new forms of social infrastructure that facilitate economic exchange, a phenomenon explored in @@CITATION (Fourcade & Kluttz, 2020).\\n5.  Whereas Granovetter emphasized how social ties enable economic action, a contrasting view argues that certain strong ties, such as those in tightly-knit communities, can actually hinder market development through excessive claims and obligations, a paradox presented in @@CITATION (Portes, 1998).\\n6.  The performativity thesis, which posits that economic theories (like neoclassical models) can shape the realities they purport to describe, offers a distinct mechanism of embeddedness through discourse and calculation, as argued in @@CITATION (MacKenzie, 2006).\\n7.  Similar to Granovetter's argument against atomized actors, research on moral economies demonstrates that economic behavior is often governed by deeply held ethical beliefs and notions of justice, not just calculative interest, a theme central to @@CITATION (Sayer, 2000).\\n8.  A crucial difference emerges when considering that social networks can be used for explicitly anti-economic or destructive purposes, such as in the operation of illicit markets, a domain where the Granovetterian framework is critically applied in @@CITATION (Beckert & Dewey, 2021).\\n9.  The concept of embeddedness finds a strong parallel in Bourdieu's theory of practice, which argues that economic dispositions are ingrained through habitus and that capital exists in multiple social forms, a comprehensive framework laid out in @@CITATION (Bourdieu, 2005).\\n10.

As a PhD student in Economic Sociology, I would argue that understanding economic action requires a foundational grasp of its social embeddedness, a concept famously articulated by @@CITATION (Granovetter 1985), which posits that economic behaviors are deeply enmeshed in networks of social relations. This perspective challenges the neoclassical view of the atomized actor by showing how social structures, particularly networks @@CITATION (Granovetter 2005), create trust, disseminate information, and shape opportunities in markets. Furthermore, the very emergence of the market economy was not a natural occurrence but a political project, a process of disembedding and re-embedding described in the seminal work on the great transformation by @@CITATION (Polanyi 1944). Within these constructed markets, actors compete not only for economic capital but also for symbolic power, a form of capital analyzed through the lens of field theory by @@CITATION (Bourdieu 2005). The stability of these fields often relies on shared cognitive frameworks, or institutional logics @@CITATION (Thornton, Ocasio, and Lounsbury 2012), which provide the rules of the game that guide and legitimize action. A key mechanism for the diffusion of these logics and practices is isomorphism, a process where organizations become similar due to coercive, mimetic, and normative pressures @@CITATION (DiMaggio and Powell 1983). The actors who skillfully navigate these pressures to create new institutions or transform existing ones are known as institutional entrepreneurs @@CITATION (Fligstein 2001), whose strategies are crucial for understanding market formation and change. This entrepreneurial action is often directed towards achieving a form of stable social order, or what has been termed a conception of control @@CITATION (Fligstein 1990), which dominates a given market field. The valuation of goods within these fields is also a profoundly social process, as shown in the research on valuation and worth @@CITATION (Boltanski and Thévenot 2006), which demonstrates how multiple orders of justification are mobilized to determine value.

Exploring the causal relationship between the rise of passive investing and its effect on price discovery, corporate governance, and market volatility remains a paramount empirical question, requiring methodologies that address endogeneity concerns as suggested by @@CITATION.\\n7.  Future work must quantify the hedging effectiveness and pricing dynamics of carbon emission allowances within multi-asset investment portfolios, integrating them into modern portfolio theory in a manner similar to @@CITATION.\\n8.  The role of non-bank financial intermediaries, such as private credit funds, in propagating financial shocks during periods of stress warrants a deeper investigation into their interconnectedness with the broader banking system, a gap identified by @@CITATION.\\n9.  Developing dynamic asset pricing models that incorporate investor sentiment extracted from social media data could significantly improve the explanatory power for momentum and reversal anomalies, building upon the behavioral finance literature of @@CITATION.\\n10. An important avenue for future research is to analyze the long-term effects of geoeconomic fragmentation on global capital allocation, supply chain financing, and the cost of capital for emerging markets, a topic urgently called for by @@CITATION.\", 'refusal': None, 'reasoning': \"Hmm, the user wants me to generate 10 citations in the style of future work references, specifically for financial economics.

As a Full Professor in Electoral Studies, here are 10 citations written in the requested style, each demonstrating the use of a specific data source, methodological approach, or foundational finding from the electoral studies literature.\\n\\n1.  To model the complex relationship between economic perceptions and vote choice, we employ a multi-level framework that accounts for both individual-level socioeconomic status and contextual county-level data, a technique powerfully demonstrated by @@CITATION.\\n\\n2.  The analysis of voter polarization relies on measuring ideological constraint within party coalitions over time, a task for which we utilize the sophisticated scaling methods applied to survey data as seen in @@CITATION.\\n\\n3.  Our investigation into the demographic shifts within the American electorate depends on the high-quality, long-term panel data meticulously collected and made available by @@CITATION.\\n\\n4.  To identify the causal effect of negative advertising on voter turnout, we designed a natural experiment leveraging variation in ad exposure across media markets, a research design principle championed by @@CITATION.\\n\\n5.  The classification of electoral systems and their mechanical effects on party systems and representation draws heavily on the seminal typology and comparative framework established by @@CITATION.\\n\\n6.  Estimating the impact of voter identification laws on turnout, particularly among minority populations, requires sophisticated matching techniques to create valid counterfactuals, a methodological challenge expertly addressed by @@CITATION.\\n\\n7.  Our understanding of how campaign spending influences electoral outcomes was fundamentally reshaped by the instrumental variables approach used to disentangle correlation from causation in @@CITATION.\\n\\n8.  The theory of affective polarization, which posits that partisan identity has evolved into a strong social identity driving animosity toward the opposing party, is empirically tested and advanced in the work of @@CITATION.\\n\\n9.  To track the rise of economic nationalism as a voting determinant, we analyze text data from party manifestos and campaign speeches using the same dictionary-based content analysis methods pioneered by @@CITATION.\\n\\n10. Mapping the ideological placement of voters and candidates onto a common scale to assess representation is achieved through the Bayesian Aldrich-McKelvey scaling technique, the statistical underpinnings of which are detailed in @@CITATION.', 'refusal': None, 'reasoning': 'Hmm, the user wants me to act as a Full Professor in Electoral Studies and create 10 citations following a specific format where the citation placeholder @@CITATION is embedded mid-sentence.
