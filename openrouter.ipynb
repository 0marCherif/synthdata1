The examples provided show that these citations often involve tools, datasets, frameworks, or methodologies borrowed from other studies. \\n\\nI need to ensure each citation clearly indicates what is being used—whether it\\'s a coding scheme, analytical framework, software, or dataset. The citations should be diverse in terms of ethnographic methods (e.g., participant observation, discourse analysis, digital ethnography) and contexts (e.g., urban studies, online communities, healthcare). \\n\\nI’ll structure each citation to start with the action (e.g., \"We adopt,\" \"The analysis employs\") followed by the specific element being used and the citation placeholder. The tone should be academic but straightforward, mirroring the examples.'}}], 'usage': {'prompt_tokens': 3560, 'completion_tokens': 565, 'total_tokens': 4125, 'prompt_tokens_details': None}}\n"
