Explanation:  
The citation refers to "previous sentiment-analysis work" that "has considered inter-document similarity" with specific citations (Agarwal and Bhattacharyya, 2005; Pang and Lee, 2005; Goldberg and Zhu, 2006). This explicitly places the cited works as foundational research in the domain, establishing context and existing knowledge. The purpose is to **provide relevant background information**, not to motivate new work, use methods, extend findings, contrast approaches, or suggest future research.  

Thus, it aligns with Category 0: **BACKGROUND**.

The phrase "the method we are currently using ... (Seneff et al. 1991)" clearly indicates that the cited work's **method is actively employed** in the authors' current approach. This aligns perfectly with the "USES" category, defined as using data, methods, etc., from the citation.

The citation references prior work (Collins, 1997; Charniak, 1997a, 1997b; Ratnaparkhi, 1997; etc.) to establish the existing state of the field and foundational research in statistical methods for parsing. This provides context and information relevant to the domain being discussed, fulfilling the **BACKGROUND** intent.

*   It does not "use" the cited methods (USES/1).
*   It does not contrast them (COMPARES OR CONTRASTS/2).
*   It does not cite them to illustrate a specific problem to solve (MOTIVATION/3).
*   It does not state the current work extends them (CONTINUATION/4).
*   It does not suggest future work based on them (FUTURE/5).

The citation provides foundational context by referencing seminal works and an active bibliography in sentiment analysis, establishing the research domain for the current work. This aligns with **BACKGROUND** (categorical purpose: "to provide relevant information for this domain").

The citation lists established methodologies ("dictionary-based", "ontology-based", etc.) with examples (e.g., Lesk, 1986) to provide foundational knowledge and context about existing approaches in the field. This clearly fits the BACKGROUND intent (0), as it informs the reader about prior work without extending, comparing, motivating new work, or using those specific methods directly.

**Explanation:**  
The citation contrasts prior works (Chafe 1979, etc.) with the author's current approach by highlighting a **shared limitation** ("all of them share a certain limitation"). This explicitly points out a *difference* or *shortcoming* in existing methods, which falls under "COMPARES OR CONTRASTS".  

*   **Key Phrase:** "all of them share a certain limitation" signals a comparison focusing on a difference (inadequacy).
*   **Not BACKGROUND:** While it mentions existing discussions, the focal point is their inadequacy, not just providing domain context.
*   **Not MOTIVATION:** It critiques prior work but doesn't explicitly state this as the *reason* or motivation for the author's new work (though it's implied).
*   **Not USES/CONTINUATION/FUTURE:** The citation isn't used for its data/methods, extended, or proposed as future work.

The citation states that the authors re-use existing binary features from prior works by Pang et al. (2002), Pang and Lee (2004), and Zaidan et al. (2007). The phrase **"We use the same set of binary features as in previous work"** explicitly indicates adoption of existing methods. This falls under the **"USES"** intent (using data/methods).  

**ANSWER: 1** (USES)


Based on the citation context:  
"Our classification framework, **directly inspired by** Blum and Chawla (2001), **integrates** both perspectives..."  

- The phrase "directly inspired by" indicates adoption of core concepts/methods.  
- "Integrates both perspectives" confirms active application of the cited work's methodology.  
- This aligns with **USES** (using methods from the citation).

The citation lists prior work on Arabic treebanks ("results have been reported on") to establish existing research in the domain. This directly aligns with the BACKGROUND intent (0), which is defined as providing relevant domain information. The text does not indicate using methods (USES/1), extending work (CONTINUATION/4), comparing approaches (COMPARES OR CONTRASTS/2), motivating new research (MOTIVATION/3), or suggesting future work (FUTURE/5).

Based on the classification definitions and the example citation text:

*   The citation describes a specific detail (training data size) from the Palmer and Hearst (1997) study.
*   The author is **providing relevant information about prior work in the domain**, specifically details about a method used in a related study.
*   There is no indication the citing paper is using that specific data/method (`USES`), motivated by a problem it solves (`MOTIVATION`), extending the cited method (`CONTINUATION`), comparing/contrasting it (`COMPARES OR CONTRASTS`), or suggesting it for `FUTURE` work.

Therefore, the intent of the citation is **BACKGROUND (0)**.

The citation criticizes existing thresholding strategies (from Gale & Church 1991, etc.) by stating they fail despite being "clever" due to an imbalance. This directly **illustrates a problem or limitation** in prior methods, serving as the **MOTIVATION** for the authors' approach or solution in addressing this gap.  

**Reasoning:**  
- The sentence emphasizes a failure/shortcoming ("foils") in cited works.  
- Highlighting limitations of prior research creates justification for the current work, fitting MOTIVATION (intent 3).  
- *(Not BACKGROUND: No domain knowledge is provided; not USES/CONTINUATION: Methods aren't adopted or extended; not COMPARE: No direct similarity/difference analysis; not FUTURE: No forward-looking suggestion.)*

The citation lists prior methods for computing semantic relatedness (e.g., dictionary-based, ontology-based) to establish foundational knowledge in the domain, aligning with **BACKGROUND**. It surveys existing approaches without indicating usage, extension, comparison, or future application.

ANSWER WITH THE CORRECT ASSOCIATED NUMBER: **0**

Based on the analysis of the citation context:

*   The sentence describes **another line of research** that exists in the field ("approaches grounded language knowledge..."). 
*   It summarizes **what that existing research does** ("augmenting distributional approaches... with perceptual information").
*   It lists several works that fall into this category.
*   There is no indication that the *current* paper is directly using, extending, contrasting motivations/problems, or comparing/contrasting this work. Nor is it suggested as future work.
*   The citation primarily serves to **provide context and establish existing knowledge** in the domain relevant to the current paper's subject matter.

Therefore, the intent is to provide **Background**.

- No comparison, extension, or background justification implied.  

**Answer**: 1

1:USES  

The citation (Lin and Hovy 2003) directly indicates **use of the ROUGE tool** for sequence-based measures in the authors' work. The phrase "employed sequence-based measures using the ROUGE tool set" explicitly demonstrates the *application* of a method from the cited source, aligning with the definition of "USES" (using methods or data from the citation). While a similarity in results is mentioned, the core intent remains the adoption of the cited tool/method.  

**Breakdown**:  
- **"Employed sequence-based measures using ROUGE"**: Explicitly states utilization of the cited work’s method.  
- **Not Background**: Not providing foundational context/theory.  
- **Not Motivation**: Not justifying a research gap or need.  
- **Not Continuation**: No extension or improvement of the ROUGE method is claimed.  
- **Not Compares/Contrasts**: Mentioning similar results is a byproduct, not the primary act of comparison.  
- **Not Future**: No future work suggestion.

Based on the context, the citation "(Levin, 1993)" serves to establish the foundational "typical solution" to the redundancy problem in the field. The author references Levin's work as **BACKGROUND** knowledge, providing essential context for the domain and framing the existing approach to verb grouping based on argument realization patterns. It introduces prior work without indicating current usage, extension, comparison, or future application.

Therefore, the associated number is:  
**0**

3  
(Index: MOTIVATION)

**Reasoning:**  
The sentence cites Hobbs' work to highlight his *emphasis on a specific need* (using "salience" for fact selection in a knowledge base). This directly illustrates a need **("emphasized the need for")** within the problem domain, fitting the MOTIVATION intent (indicating why a concept or approach is important).  

*   It is not merely BACKGROUND (0), as it specifically identifies a requirement to address a challenge.  
*   It does not indicate the current work USES (1) or EXTENDS (4: CONTINUATION) Hobbs' method.  
*   No comparison (2) or future work (5) is mentioned.

The citation (Harris, 1971) describes the *use* of an established method ("distributional analysis") from prior work to achieve a goal ("build classes of semantically related terms"). The phrase "have relied on" explicitly indicates direct application/usage of the cited work's methodology. This aligns with the definition of **USES (1)**: "to use data, methods, etc from the citation."  

*   Not BACKGROUND (context setup)  
*   Not COMPARES OR CONTRASTS (no evaluation of similarities/differences)  
*   Not MOTIVATION (doesn't establish a problem/gap)  
*   Not CONTINUATION (not extending/modifying Harris's method here)  
*   Not FUTURE (not suggesting later work)

The citation states the authors "find that the Bayesian SCFG grammar can not even significantly outperform the heuristic SCFG grammar (Blunsom et al. 2009)". This explicitly **compares the performance** (Bayesian vs. heuristic SCFG) and highlights a difference (lack of significant outperformance). This fits the intent "COMPARES OR CONTRASTS". 

*   **Reasoning Breakdown:**
    *   Does it provide background? (0: BACKGROUND) - No, it states a finding/result.
    *   Does it state a need or motivate? (3: MOTIVATION) - No, it describes a result.
    *   Does it use the cited work? (1: USES) - No, it assesses the cited work's approach.
    *   Does it extend the cited work? (4: CONTINUATION) - No, it comments on the cited work's outcome.
    *   Does it discuss future work? (5: FUTURE) - No, it discusses a current result/limitation.
    *   **Does it compare or contrast? (2: COMPARES OR CONTRASTS) - YES.** It directly compares the performance/effectiveness of two methods/models.

Based on the analysis of the citation context:  
- The text **describes Smith and Eisner's specific method** (adding a constraint and using "structural annealing") to address locality in dependency parsing.  
- This serves as **foundational knowledge** for the current paper's domain/topic (unsupervised dependency parsing), not as a direct application, extension, comparison, or future work by the current authors.  
- Fits **BACKGROUND** (0).  

**Answer: 0**

The citation states that the current work's architecture "is based on that of" the cited studies (Moore et al., 1997; Stent et al., 1999). This indicates **direct utilization of methods or foundational ideas, or structural frameworks** from those works**, aligning with "USES" (1)**.

The citation provides historical and terminological context by listing how different researchers have named key components over time. It establishes existing nomenclature to frame the current work, fulfilling the **Background** role (0). This is distinct from:

- **Motivation (3)**: Which would identify a problem/gap the current study solves (absent here).
- **Uses (1)/Continuation (4)**: Which imply employing or building on the cited works' methods/data (not indicated).
- **Compares/Contrasts (2)**: Which explicitly highlights similarities/differences (mentioned terminological *variation* isn't an analytical comparison).
- **Future (5)**: Which suggests further research paths (not present).

Based on the citation context:

*   The text states a current research interest exists **"because"** prior work (Chi et al., 1994; etc.) established that high percentages of self-explanation are correlated with better learning.
*   This citation directly **illustrates the *reason* and *need*** (the motivation) for the research direction (developing tutorial dialogue systems that understand student explanations). It provides the justification *why* the field is pursuing this line of research.

*Reasoning: The citation "(Marom and Zukerman 2007a)" refers directly to the system whose responses are being assessed in the study. The phrase "assess the responses generated **by our system (Marom and Zukerman 2007a)**" indicates the authors are **using** the methods, data, or outputs from the cited work. This aligns with the "USES" intent (using data, methods, etc. from the citation).*

**Explanation:**  
The citation indicates the authors are **using** the pruning techniques developed by Snover et al. (2009) to improve the precision of their extracted paraphrases. There is no mention of background context, motivation, extension, comparison, or future work—only the direct application ("can be applied") of the cited method.  

**Associated Number:** 1 (USES)

The citation indicates the paper is **extending** existing model adaptation methods (studied by Bacchiani et al., Bellegarda, and Gao et al.) from statistical language modeling to ranking models for web search. The key phrase is "**we extend**", which directly aligns with:  
> "CONTINUATION: to extend the citation's data, methods, etc."  

This fits category **4** (CONTINUATION).  

**Rejected options:**  
- *Background (0)*: The citations provide foundational work, but the sentence emphasizes extension, not background context.  
- *Uses (1)*: While methods are used, the core action is *extending* them to a new domain, not merely applying them.  
- *Compares/Contrasts (2)* / *Motivation (3)* / *Future (5)*: No language indicates comparison, problem motivation, or future work.  

Thus, **4** (CONTINUATION) is correct.

The citation "Perlis (1985) describes how first order logic can be augmented with such an operator" serves to provide foundational domain knowledge about augmenting logic with a quotation operator. This fits the **BACKGROUND** category (0) as it contextualizes existing research without extending, using, or contrasting it. The paper references Perlis (1985) to establish prior work, not to motivate, compare, or propose future applications. 

- **Key indicators**: "describes" implies exposition of existing concepts  
- **Lack of indicators**: No usage of methods ("we use Perlis' operator..."), comparison ("unlike Perlis..."), or future directions ("could be expanded...")

Thus,  
**0**

4:CONTINUATION  

Explanation:  
The citation references "description-level lexical rules (DLRs; Meurers 1995)" as a direct foundation. The subsequent text ("Meta-Level Lexical Rules") indicates the authors are proposing an extension or advancement of Meurers' work. This fits **CONTINUATION (4)**: extending the cited work's methods or concepts.  

Key clues:  
- The citation is explicitly named ("DLRs") as a precursor.  
- The new term ("Meta-Level Lexical Rules") is introduced immediately after, signaling progression.  
- No contrast, motivation, or mention of future work is present.  

Thus, the intent is to *extend* the cited lexical framework.

0


0  

**Reasoning:**  
- The citation text ("The necessity...recognized before") explicitly references prior work (Charniak & McDermott, Hobbs) to establish existing knowledge and terminology in the domain.  
  - Phrases like "recognized before" and the naming of foundational terms ("abductive unification," "knitting") indicate the author is providing historical context and background concepts.  
- No other intent fits: There is no application of methods (**USES**), extension (**CONTINUATION**), problem motivation (**MOTIVATION**), comparison (**COMPARES OR CONTRASTS**), or future work proposal (**FUTURE**).  
- Thus, it purely serves as **BACKGROUND** (Category 0).

The citation references prior work (Kathol 1994; Krieger and Nerbonne 1992) to establish how lexical generalizations have been handled in existing literature. This provides foundational context for the current work, using the cited papers as domain background rather than extending, applying, or contrasting their methods. 

**Key indicators**:  
- Neutral descriptive framing ("lexical generalizations are captured")  
- Cites general approaches ("proposals") rather than specific tools/data  
- No operational language signaling usage/extension/comparison  
- Positions cited works as historical context for the problem space  

**Classification**: BACKGROUND (0) - Providing relevant domain information.

- The citation points to prior studies that **support/validate** a concept (paragraph units).  
- The phrase "can be found in" indicates these references are provided as **existing evidence** within the domain.  
- The function is to **establish foundational knowledge** or corroborate a claim, not to motivate new work, use methods, extend, contrast, or suggest future work.

**Explanation:**  
The citation lists specific prior parsers (Ratnaparkhi 1999, Collins 1999, etc.) to **directly compare results** against the author's lexicalized model ("SSN-Freq > 200"). Presenting them together in a table panel explicitly juxtaposes their outcomes for evaluation, aligning with "COMPARES OR CONTRASTS" (Association Number 2).

**Breakdown:**  
- ❌ Not **BACKGROUND** (doesn't establish domain fundamentals).  
- ❌ Not **MOTIVATION** (doesn’t frame a problem requiring this work).  
- ❌ Not **USES** (doesn’t indicate adoption of their methods/data; only contrasts results).  
- ❌ Not **CONTINUATION** (no claim of extending the cited parsers’ work).  
- ❌ Not **FUTURE** (no forward-looking suggestion).  
- ✅ **COMPARES OR CONTRASTS**: The table panel explicitly benchmarks results against prior work.

Based on the citation context:  
The text contrasts different approaches ("sometimes as the only feature... sometimes in combination with others") by referencing multiple sources (Sugiyama and Okumura vs. Chen and Martin/Popescu and Magnini). This explicitly **compares or contrasts** methodologies across cited works.  

**Answer: 2**

Based on the citation context – specifically the phrase **"the method *extends* an existing... method"** – this indicates the cited work is being explicitly built upon and developed further. It directly describes an *extension* of prior research.

**Correct Classification:** CONTINUATION (EXTENDS)
**Answer: 4**

**Explanation of reasoning (for understanding, not part of answer):**
*   The key phrase is **"extends an existing flat shallow-parsing method"**.
*   This shows the current work *develops* or *expands* the data/methods/concepts from Skut and Brants (1998) and Buchholz et al. (1999).
*   It perfectly matches the CONTINUATION label: "to extend the citation's data, methods, etc.".
*   The phrase "In a similar vain" shows similarity/direction but the core action is "extends", making COMPARES OR CONTRASTS (2) less specific than the act of extension itself.


Based on the citation context, the intent is:
- The text describes how researchers re-adopted the knowledge-rich approach by investigating semantic knowledge sources.
- Citations like Ji et al. (2005), Poesio et al. (2004), Ponzetto and Strube (2006), and Bean and Riloff (2004) are used as **existing examples** of these semantic sources.
- This illustrates prior work and establishes domain context, fitting "BACKGROUND".

The citation "Church and Hanks 1990" is introduced to **illustrate a gap in the current work** – specifically, the lack of comparison between the authors' results (using G2 and Fisher's test) and results obtained using the MI measure. This highlights a motive for addressing this absent comparison, making it **Motivation (3)**. It does not compare yet (2), nor is it about future work (5), background (0), using the method (1), or extending it (4).

0:BACKGROUND

The citation provides established domain knowledge about a known problem in information retrieval (negative impact of morphological alterations on recall), positioning it as background context for the current work. It does not describe using the cited methods (USES), extending them (CONTINUATION), motivating new work (MOTIVATION), comparing approaches (COMPARES OR CONTRASTS), or suggesting future work (FUTURE).

*   **Analysis:** The authors are citing these papers to **describe existing frameworks and approaches** (HPSG and LFG + glue semantics). This establishes fundamental concepts or prior work relevant to the domain/problem addressed by the current paper. The verbs "describes" and "show how to equip" indicate the citation is presenting established information, not using it directly, extending it, contrasting it, motivating the current work based on a gap, or pointing to future work. It provides the required context or foundation (BACKGROUND).

The citation "Such approaches have been tried recently in restricted cases (McCallum et al., 2000; Eisner, 2001b; Lafferty et al., 2001)" provides **background context** about prior research on similar approaches (albeit in limited scenarios). It establishes foundational work without:  
- Using methods/data (**USES**, 1),  
- Extending the cited works (**CONTINUATION**, 4),  
- Highlighting a problem (**MOTIVATION**, 3),  
- Comparing similarities/differences (**COMPARES**, 2), or  
- Suggesting future work (**FUTURE**, 5).

The citation references Bing (1985) to establish existing knowledge ("has been examined in some detail") about the relationship between discourse and prosodic phrasing. This provides foundational context for the current paper's domain, fitting the BACKGROUND intent (0). The author is summarizing prior work, not using its methods, extending it, contrasting it, motivating new work, or suggesting future work.

Based on the phrase "By contrast" and the presentation of specific performance metrics from the cited works (Oflazer et al., 2003; Atalay et al., 2003) to highlight differences in parsing performance (high root accuracy vs. low attachment scores), the citation intent is **COMPARES OR CONTRASTS**.

The citation indicates the authors **used** the Moses toolkit for extracting the bilingual phrase table, directly applying Koehn et al.'s methods/tools (USES).  

**Reasoning:**  
- The sentence explicitly states *"using the Moses toolkit (Koehn et al., 2007)"*, focusing on **application** of a tool/method from the cited work.  
- No comparison, extension, critique, or foundational context is implied—only direct utilization.  
- Matches USES: *"to use data, methods, etc. from the citation."* 

Based on the phrase "Representative systems are described in...", the citation is clearly used to **provide examples of existing technology or foundational work relevant to the paper's domain**. There is no indication the current work is using, extending, contrasting, or motivated by these specific older systems. They are simply presented as representative examples of background knowledge or prior art in the field.

**This is a classic BACKGROUND citation (0)**.

// The citation states that the rules and account are "adopted... from" the cited works (G&G 1987 and Selkirk 1984). This directly indicates the authors **used** existing methods/data ("rules for phonological word formation" and "account of monosyllabic destressing") from these sources in their own work, aligning with the "USES" intent (category 1). There is no indication of providing background, motivation, continuation, comparison, or future work.


Based on the text: "As a generalization, Briscoe (2001) notes that lexicons such as COMLEX tend to demonstrate high precision but low recall."

*   The citation presents existing knowledge (a noted characteristic of lexicons like COMLEX) relevant to the domain the current paper is working in.
*   It is a statement of established fact/generalization from the cited work, used to set the context or baseline understanding for the current paper.
*   It does not: motivate a gap, use a method, extend the work, compare/contrast directly (it states the cited work's observation), or suggest future work.

Therefore, the citation provides **BACKGROUND** information.

The citation lists prior work (Fillmore and Atkins, 1998; Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Hull and Gomez, 1996; Rosario et al., 2002) that explored information extraction from syntactic units (clauses or noun phrases). It provides general **context** and foundational work relevant to the domain (semantic role labeling/frame semantics), without indicating the current paper uses specific methods/data, extends them, contrasts them, identifies a gap, or suggests future work.

**Reasoning:**
1.  **Doesn't state USE:** No explicit signal the current work employs these specific methods/data.
2.  **Doesn't state EXTENSION/CONTINUATION:** No signal the current work *builds upon*, modifies, or improves these cited methods.
3.  **Doesn't state COMPARE/CONTRAST:** No words like "unlike", "contrasts", "similarly", "difference".
4.  **Doesn't state MOTIVATION:** Doesn't identify a *gap* or *problem* in this prior work necessitating the current study.
5.  **Doesn't state FUTURE:** Doesn't suggest the cited works propose or need future work.
6.  **Does provide BACKGROUND:** Explicitly presents existing/previous work to establish context and relevant foundations in the field ("Such systems extract information from...").

Explanation:  
The citation refers to "previous sentiment-analysis work" that "has considered inter-document similarity" with specific citations (Agarwal and Bhattacharyya, 2005; Pang and Lee, 2005; Goldberg and Zhu, 2006). This explicitly places the cited works as foundational research in the domain, establishing context and existing knowledge. The purpose is to **provide relevant background information**, not to motivate new work, use methods, extend findings, contrast approaches, or suggest future research.  

Thus, it aligns with Category 0: **BACKGROUND**.

The phrase "the method we are currently using ... (Seneff et al. 1991)" clearly indicates that the cited work's **method is actively employed** in the authors' current approach. This aligns perfectly with the "USES" category, defined as using data, methods, etc., from the citation.

The citation references prior work (Collins, 1997; Charniak, 1997a, 1997b; Ratnaparkhi, 1997; etc.) to establish the existing state of the field and foundational research in statistical methods for parsing. This provides context and information relevant to the domain being discussed, fulfilling the **BACKGROUND** intent.

*   It does not "use" the cited methods (USES/1).
*   It does not contrast them (COMPARES OR CONTRASTS/2).
*   It does not cite them to illustrate a specific problem to solve (MOTIVATION/3).
*   It does not state the current work extends them (CONTINUATION/4).
*   It does not suggest future work based on them (FUTURE/5).

The citation provides foundational context by referencing seminal works and an active bibliography in sentiment analysis, establishing the research domain for the current work. This aligns with **BACKGROUND** (categorical purpose: "to provide relevant information for this domain").

**Explanation:**  
The citation contrasts prior works (Chafe 1979, etc.) with the author's current approach by highlighting a **shared limitation** ("all of them share a certain limitation"). This explicitly points out a *difference* or *shortcoming* in existing methods, which falls under "COMPARES OR CONTRASTS".  

*   **Key Phrase:** "all of them share a certain limitation" signals a comparison focusing on a difference (inadequacy).
*   **Not BACKGROUND:** While it mentions existing discussions, the focal point is their inadequacy, not just providing domain context.
*   **Not MOTIVATION:** It critiques prior work but doesn't explicitly state this as the *reason* or motivation for the author's new work (though it's implied).
*   **Not USES/CONTINUATION/FUTURE:** The citation isn't used for its data/methods, extended, or proposed as future work.

The citation lists prior work on Arabic treebanks ("results have been reported on") to establish existing research in the domain. This directly aligns with the BACKGROUND intent (0), which is defined as providing relevant domain information. The text does not indicate using methods (USES/1), extending work (CONTINUATION/4), comparing approaches (COMPARES OR CONTRASTS/2), motivating new research (MOTIVATION/3), or suggesting future work (FUTURE/5).

Based on the classification definitions and the example citation text:

*   The citation describes a specific detail (training data size) from the Palmer and Hearst (1997) study.
*   The author is **providing relevant information about prior work in the domain**, specifically details about a method used in a related study.
*   There is no indication the citing paper is using that specific data/method (`USES`), motivated by a problem it solves (`MOTIVATION`), extending the cited method (`CONTINUATION`), comparing/contrasting it (`COMPARES OR CONTRASTS`), or suggesting it for `FUTURE` work.

Therefore, the intent of the citation is **BACKGROUND (0)**.

The citation criticizes existing thresholding strategies (from Gale & Church 1991, etc.) by stating they fail despite being "clever" due to an imbalance. This directly **illustrates a problem or limitation** in prior methods, serving as the **MOTIVATION** for the authors' approach or solution in addressing this gap.  

**Reasoning:**  
- The sentence emphasizes a failure/shortcoming ("foils") in cited works.  
- Highlighting limitations of prior research creates justification for the current work, fitting MOTIVATION (intent 3).  
- *(Not BACKGROUND: No domain knowledge is provided; not USES/CONTINUATION: Methods aren't adopted or extended; not COMPARE: No direct similarity/difference analysis; not FUTURE: No forward-looking suggestion.)*

The citation (Lin and Hovy 2003) directly indicates **use of the ROUGE tool** for sequence-based measures in the authors' work. The phrase "employed sequence-based measures using the ROUGE tool set" explicitly demonstrates the *application* of a method from the cited source, aligning with the definition of "USES" (using methods or data from the citation). While a similarity in results is mentioned, the core intent remains the adoption of the cited tool/method.  

**Breakdown**:  
- **"Employed sequence-based measures using ROUGE"**: Explicitly states utilization of the cited work’s method.  
- **Not Background**: Not providing foundational context/theory.  
- **Not Motivation**: Not justifying a research gap or need.  
- **Not Continuation**: No extension or improvement of the ROUGE method is claimed.  
- **Not Compares/Contrasts**: Mentioning similar results is a byproduct, not the primary act of comparison.  
- **Not Future**: No future work suggestion.

(Index: MOTIVATION)

**Reasoning:**  
The sentence cites Hobbs' work to highlight his *emphasis on a specific need* (using "salience" for fact selection in a knowledge base). This directly illustrates a need **("emphasized the need for")** within the problem domain, fitting the MOTIVATION intent (indicating why a concept or approach is important).  

*   It is not merely BACKGROUND (0), as it specifically identifies a requirement to address a challenge.  
*   It does not indicate the current work USES (1) or EXTENDS (4: CONTINUATION) Hobbs' method.  
*   No comparison (2) or future work (5) is mentioned.

- **Uses (1)/Continuation (4)**: Which imply employing or building on the cited works' methods/data (not indicated).
- **Compares/Contrasts (2)**: Which explicitly highlights similarities/differences (mentioned terminological *variation* isn't an analytical comparison).
- **Future (5)**: Which suggests further research paths (not present).

Based on the citation context:

*   The text states a current research interest exists **"because"** prior work (Chi et al., 1994; etc.) established that high percentages of self-explanation are correlated with better learning.
*   This citation directly **illustrates the *reason* and *need*** (the motivation) for the research direction (developing tutorial dialogue systems that understand student explanations). It provides the justification *why* the field is pursuing this line of research.

The citation indicates the paper is **extending** existing model adaptation methods (studied by Bacchiani et al., Bellegarda, and Gao et al.) from statistical language modeling to ranking models for web search. The key phrase is "**we extend**", which directly aligns with:  
> "CONTINUATION: to extend the citation's data, methods, etc."  

This fits category **4** (CONTINUATION).  

**Rejected options:**  
- *Background (0)*: The citations provide foundational work, but the sentence emphasizes extension, not background context.  
- *Uses (1)*: While methods are used, the core action is *extending* them to a new domain, not merely applying them.  
- *Compares/Contrasts (2)* / *Motivation (3)* / *Future (5)*: No language indicates comparison, problem motivation, or future work.  

Thus, **4** (CONTINUATION) is correct.

This fits **CONTINUATION (4)**: extending the cited work's methods or concepts.  

Key clues:  
- The citation is explicitly named ("DLRs") as a precursor.  
- The new term ("Meta-Level Lexical Rules") is introduced immediately after, signaling progression.  
- No contrast, motivation, or mention of future work is present.  

Thus, the intent is to *extend* the cited lexical framework.

**Reasoning:**  
- The citation text ("The necessity...recognized before") explicitly references prior work (Charniak & McDermott, Hobbs) to establish existing knowledge and terminology in the domain.  
  - Phrases like "recognized before" and the naming of foundational terms ("abductive unification," "knitting") indicate the author is providing historical context and background concepts.  
- No other intent fits: There is no application of methods (**USES**), extension (**CONTINUATION**), problem motivation (**MOTIVATION**), comparison (**COMPARES OR CONTRASTS**), or future work proposal (**FUTURE**).  
- Thus, it purely serves as **BACKGROUND** (Category 0).

0

The citation references prior work (Kathol 1994; Krieger and Nerbonne 1992) to establish how lexical generalizations have been handled in existing literature. This provides foundational context for the current work, using the cited papers as domain background rather than extending, applying, or contrasting their methods. 

**Key indicators**:  
- Neutral descriptive framing ("lexical generalizations are captured")  
- Cites general approaches ("proposals") rather than specific tools/data  
- No operational language signaling usage/extension/comparison  
- Positions cited works as historical context for the problem space  

**Classification**: BACKGROUND (0) - Providing relevant domain information.

Based on the citation context:  
"Other psycholing-uistic studies that **confirm the validity** of paragraph units **can be found in** Black and Bower (1979) and Haberlandt et al. (1980)."  

### Analysis:  
- The citation points to prior studies that **support/validate** a concept (paragraph units).  
- The phrase "can be found in" indicates these references are provided as **existing evidence** within the domain.  
- The function is to **establish foundational knowledge** or corroborate a claim, not to motivate new work, use methods, extend, contrast, or suggest future work.  

**Classification:** `BACKGROUND` (0)  

**ANSWER:** 0

**Explanation:**  
The citation lists specific prior parsers (Ratnaparkhi 1999, Collins 1999, etc.) to **directly compare results** against the author's lexicalized model ("SSN-Freq > 200"). Presenting them together in a table panel explicitly juxtaposes their outcomes for evaluation, aligning with "COMPARES OR CONTRASTS" (Association Number 2).

**Breakdown:**  
- ❌ Not **BACKGROUND** (doesn't establish domain fundamentals).  
- ❌ Not **MOTIVATION** (doesn’t frame a problem requiring this work).  
- ❌ Not **USES** (doesn’t indicate adoption of their methods/data; only contrasts results).  
- ❌ Not **CONTINUATION** (no claim of extending the cited parsers’ work).  
- ❌ Not **FUTURE** (no forward-looking suggestion).  
- ✅ **COMPARES OR CONTRASTS**: The table panel explicitly benchmarks results against prior work.

Based on the citation context:  
The text contrasts different approaches ("sometimes as the only feature... sometimes in combination with others") by referencing multiple sources (Sugiyama and Okumura vs. Chen and Martin/Popescu and Magnini). This explicitly **compares or contrasts** methodologies across cited works.  

**Answer: 2**

Based on the citation context – specifically the phrase **"the method *extends* an existing... method"** – this indicates the cited work is being explicitly built upon and developed further. It directly describes an *extension* of prior research.

**Correct Classification:** CONTINUATION (EXTENDS)
**Answer: 4**

**Explanation of reasoning (for understanding, not part of answer):**
*   The key phrase is **"extends an existing flat shallow-parsing method"**.
*   This shows the current work *develops* or *expands* the data/methods/concepts from Skut and Brants (1998) and Buchholz et al. (1999).
*   It perfectly matches the CONTINUATION label: "to extend the citation's data, methods, etc.".
*   The phrase "In a similar vain" shows similarity/direction but the core action is "extends", making COMPARES OR CONTRASTS (2) less specific than the act of extension itself.


Based on the citation context, the intent is:
- The text describes how researchers re-adopted the knowledge-rich approach by investigating semantic knowledge sources.
- Citations like Ji et al. (2005), Poesio et al. (2004), Ponzetto and Strube (2006), and Bean and Riloff (2004) are used as **existing examples** of these semantic sources.
- This illustrates prior work and establishes domain context, fitting "BACKGROUND".

**Explanation:**  
The citation explicitly states that the authors are **using existing models** ("perceptron segmentation model" and "perceptron POS tagging model") from prior works (Zhang and Clark, 2007; Collins, 2002) to build their system. This matches the **USES** intent (associated number **1**), defined as *"to use data, methods, etc from the citation."* The key verb "using" confirms operational reliance on prior resources, not merely contextual reference or extension.

The citation lists existing coreference resolution systems (Baldwin et al., Gaizauskas & Humphreys, Kameyama) as examples developed in response to MUC conferences, providing foundational domain context.  

**Reasoning:**  
- The phrase *"such as those described in"* introduces representative prior works.  
- It establishes historical developments in the field (coreference algorithms spurred by MUC).  
- No usage, extension, comparison, or future direction is indicated; it contextualizes the domain’s evolution.

Based on the citation text:  
"The most detailed evaluation of link tokens to date was performed by ( Macklovitch & Hannan , 1996 )..."  

This citation:  
1. **Describes prior work** ("the most detailed evaluation... was performed").  
2. **Establishes existing knowledge** in the field (evaluation of link tokens).  
3. **Provides context** for the current paper's domain without extending, using, or contrasting the cited work.  

It fits the definition of **BACKGROUND** (0):  
"to provide relevant information for this domain."

The citation "Church and Hanks 1990" is introduced to **illustrate a gap in the current work** – specifically, the lack of comparison between the authors' results (using G2 and Fisher's test) and results obtained using the MI measure. This highlights a motive for addressing this absent comparison, making it **Motivation (3)**. It does not compare yet (2), nor is it about future work (5), background (0), using the method (1), or extending it (4).

0:BACKGROUND

The citation provides established domain knowledge about a known problem in information retrieval (negative impact of morphological alterations on recall), positioning it as background context for the current work. It does not describe using the cited methods (USES), extending them (CONTINUATION), motivating new work (MOTIVATION), comparing approaches (COMPARES OR CONTRASTS), or suggesting future work (FUTURE).

(USES: The citation describes Watanabe's method of combining lexical and dependency mappings, indicating the *application* of his methodology in the current work.)


Based on the citation text provided:

"( Copestake and Flickinger , 2000 ; Copestake et al. , 2001 ) describes a Head Driven Phrase Structure Grammar ( HPSG ) which supports the parallel construction... and ( Dalrymple , 1999 ) show how to equip Lexical Functional grammar ( LFG ) with a glue semantics ."

*   **Analysis:** The authors are citing these papers to **describe existing frameworks and approaches** (HPSG and LFG + glue semantics). This establishes fundamental concepts or prior work relevant to the domain/problem addressed by the current paper. The verbs "describes" and "show how to equip" indicate the citation is presenting established information, not using it directly, extending it, contrasting it, motivating the current work based on a gap, or pointing to future work. It provides the required context or foundation (BACKGROUND).

*   **Classification:** This is clearly providing relevant **BACKGROUND** information for the domain.

The citation "(NIST, 2004)" and "(Hovy et al., 2006)" explicitly reference **standard datasets** used in the experiments. This directly corresponds to the **USES** category (using data/methods from the cited work), as the authors are leveraging these established datasets for their own research.  

**Reasoning breakdown:**  
- The phrase "experiments on the two standard coreference resolution datasets" signals utilization of existing resources.  
- Citations are attached to the dataset names, confirming they are the source of the data.  
- No extension, comparison, motivation, or future work is indicated.  

**Key match:**  
> *"USES: to use data, methods, etc from the citation."*

The citation describes prior research by Hohensee and Bender (2012) on dependency parsing, providing domain knowledge and contextual background for the current paper. It does not indicate the current work *uses* their methods (1), *extends* them (4), was *motivated* by them (3), *compares/contrasts* with them (2), or suggests *future* work based on them (5).  

0:BACKGROUND


The citation "Such approaches have been tried recently in restricted cases (McCallum et al., 2000; Eisner, 2001b; Lafferty et al., 2001)" provides **background context** about prior research on similar approaches (albeit in limited scenarios). It establishes foundational work without:  
- Using methods/data (**USES**, 1),  
- Extending the cited works (**CONTINUATION**, 4),  
- Highlighting a problem (**MOTIVATION**, 3),  
- Comparing similarities/differences (**COMPARES**, 2), or  
- Suggesting future work (**FUTURE**, 5).

The citation references Bing (1985) to establish existing knowledge ("has been examined in some detail") about the relationship between discourse and prosodic phrasing. This provides foundational context for the current paper's domain, fitting the BACKGROUND intent (0). The author is summarizing prior work, not using its methods, extending it, contrasting it, motivating new work, or suggesting future work.

Based on the phrase "By contrast" and the presentation of specific performance metrics from the cited works (Oflazer et al., 2003; Atalay et al., 2003) to highlight differences in parsing performance (high root accuracy vs. low attachment scores), the citation intent is **COMPARES OR CONTRASTS**.

The citation indicates the authors **used** the Moses toolkit for extracting the bilingual phrase table, directly applying Koehn et al.'s methods/tools (USES).  

**Reasoning:**  
- The sentence explicitly states *"using the Moses toolkit (Koehn et al., 2007)"*, focusing on **application** of a tool/method from the cited work.  
- No comparison, extension, critique, or foundational context is implied—only direct utilization.  
- Matches USES: *"to use data, methods, etc. from the citation."* 

Based on the phrase "Representative systems are described in...", the citation is clearly used to **provide examples of existing technology or foundational work relevant to the paper's domain**. There is no indication the current work is using, extending, contrasting, or motivated by these specific older systems. They are simply presented as representative examples of background knowledge or prior art in the field.

**This is a classic BACKGROUND citation (0)**.

ANSWER: 0

// The citation states that the rules and account are "adopted... from" the cited works (G&G 1987 and Selkirk 1984). This directly indicates the authors **used** existing methods/data ("rules for phonological word formation" and "account of monosyllabic destressing") from these sources in their own work, aligning with the "USES" intent (category 1). There is no indication of providing background, motivation, continuation, comparison, or future work.


Based on the text: "As a generalization, Briscoe (2001) notes that lexicons such as COMLEX tend to demonstrate high precision but low recall."

*   The citation presents existing knowledge (a noted characteristic of lexicons like COMLEX) relevant to the domain the current paper is working in.
*   It is a statement of established fact/generalization from the cited work, used to set the context or baseline understanding for the current paper.
*   It does not: motivate a gap, use a method, extend the work, compare/contrast directly (it states the cited work's observation), or suggest future work.

Therefore, the citation provides **BACKGROUND** information.

The citation lists prior work (Fillmore and Atkins, 1998; Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Hull and Gomez, 1996; Rosario et al., 2002) that explored information extraction from syntactic units (clauses or noun phrases). It provides general **context** and foundational work relevant to the domain (semantic role labeling/frame semantics), without indicating the current paper uses specific methods/data, extends them, contrasts them, identifies a gap, or suggests future work.

**Reasoning:**
1.  **Doesn't state USE:** No explicit signal the current work employs these specific methods/data.
2.  **Doesn't state EXTENSION/CONTINUATION:** No signal the current work *builds upon*, modifies, or improves these cited methods.
3.  **Doesn't state COMPARE/CONTRAST:** No words like "unlike", "contrasts", "similarly", "difference".
4.  **Doesn't state MOTIVATION:** Doesn't identify a *gap* or *problem* in this prior work necessitating the current study.
5.  **Doesn't state FUTURE:** Doesn't suggest the cited works propose or need future work.
6.  **Does provide BACKGROUND:** Explicitly presents existing/previous work to establish context and relevant foundations in the field ("Such systems extract information from...").

*Reasoning: The citation context describes how discriminant analysis has been historically used ("has been employed") in the field of automatic text genre detection. It explains its established role ("offers a simple and robust solution") and limitations in existing literature (Biber 1993b; Karlgren and Cutting 1994). This provides foundational context for the domain, aligning with the "BACKGROUND" category (0). There is no indication the current work uses this method (USES/1), extends it (CONTINUATION/4), compares/contrasts it (2), uses it as motivation (3), or suggests future work (5).*
