1 (USES)

**Reasoning:**
The phrase "*we use a finding from...*" explicitly indicates the current work is **utilizing** a result (the trust in weather presenters) from the cited study as part of its own data, analysis, or method. This directly corresponds to the category "1:USES". 

*   There's no indication of background, contrast, motivation for doing the work, continuation/builds upon, or future work.

(Explanation: The phrase "has shown significant gaps" indicates the prior research is being used to highlight a problem or deficiency that *motivates* the need for the current work.)

Based on scientific citation analysis conventions and the provided options, the mapping between the requested intent names and the given numbered categories is:

*   **Background** → `0:BACKGROUND`
*   **Uses** → `1:USES`
*   **Extends** → `4:CONTINUATION` (Continuation best captures "extends", as it indicates building upon prior work)
*   **Motivation** → `3:MOTIVATION`
*   **CompareOrContrast** → `2:COMPARES OR CONTRASTS`
*   **Future** → `5:FUTURE`
*   **Other** → Not explicitly listed in the number options. If forced to choose only from 0-5, it would be ambiguous. Consider querying the ambiguous case.

**Your Answer: Provide the citation text.** Without the specific sentence(s) containing the citation reference, classification is impossible. Each citation's intent is determined by the context in which it is mentioned (e.g., why the author is citing that work at that specific point in their paper). Please provide the citation context for classification.

Based on the lack of provided citation context, the intent cannot be determined and falls outside the specific categories defined. 

**Output:**
