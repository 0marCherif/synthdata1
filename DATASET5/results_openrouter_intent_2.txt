Explanation: The phrase "Building on the seminal works..." explicitly indicates the current work extends or continues the research of the cited papers, aligning with "4:CONTINUATION" (equivalent to "Extends").

Based on the standard definitions of citation intents and the numbering you provided:

**Since no citation text was provided in your query, I cannot perform the classification.**

**To classify a citation, you must provide the actual text surrounding the citation or describing its purpose.**

**Please provide the citation context text, and I will classify it immediately.**

**The classification scheme is:**

*   **0: BACKGROUND** - Provides foundational knowledge, context, or establishes the field.
*   **1: USES** - Employs a method, tool, data, or finding from the cited work.
*   **2: COMPARES OR CONTRASTS** - Discusses similarities or differences with the cited work.
*   **3: MOTIVATION** - Identifies a gap, limitation, problem, or question in the cited work that the current work addresses.
*   **4: CONTINUATION** (Equivalent to "Extends" in your first list) - Builds upon, develops, or advances the work in the cited paper.
*   **5: FUTURE** - Suggests directions for future research, often based on the cited work's findings or limitations.

6:Other *(Reason: No citation text provided for classification. "Other" is the appropriate category as none of the defined intents apply without context.)*

It appears you haven't provided the actual citation text for classification. Without the text describing *how* the cited work is used, I cannot analyze its intent.

**Please provide the citation text**, and I will classify its intent based on the categories:

0: BACKGROUND  
1: USES  
2: COMPARES OR CONTRASTS  
3: MOTIVATION  
4: CONTINUATION  
5: FUTURE


Based on the citation text: "We built upon the system described in Smith 2020 to create our new model."

*   "built upon" indicates a direct development or extension of the prior work.
*   The primary intent is to show **CONTINUATION** (Extending the cited work).

Classification: 4

Answer: `4`

0

The citation ("Numerous researchers have remarked on the ubiquity of graph representations") establishes general context and prior agreement on the topic ("ubiquity of graph representations"), placing it squarely in the **BACKGROUND (0)** category.

2

The citation explicitly states "compared... to MuSCle", describing a direct comparison between the author's proposed approach and the cited work "MuSCle", which is presented as a state-of-the-art benchmark. This fits solely under the "Compares or contrasts" category (2).

Based on the citation text "Our work builds upon the methodology introduced by Smith et al. [1]", the intent is **Extends** (building upon/continuing previous work).

The correct classification number is **4:CONTINUATION**.

The citation text is missing in the provided query. Please provide the citation context for accurate classification. Once supplied, I will categorize the citation intent based on the criteria:  
- **0: BACKGROUND**  
- **1: USES**  
- **2: COMPARES OR CONTRASTS**  
- **3: MOTIVATION**  
- **4: CONTINUATION**  
- **5: FUTURE**  

For now, since no text is available, I default to **0** (BACKGROUND) as a placeholder. Once the citation text is added, I will reassess.  

**Output:**

Without the actual citation text provided for analysis, **I cannot determine the citation intent**. 

The instruction requires the "text of the citation" to perform the classification. Since no text was included in your query, **classification is impossible**.

**Per your requirement to answer only with a number (despite missing input), I must default to:**  
**5** (FUTURE - indicating the analysis/citation is pending or anticipated).

> **Note:** This default is arbitrary. **Accurate classification requires the cited text snippet.** Provide the text for a valid analysis.

Based on scientometric classification of citation intent:

**Background (0):** Cited work provides foundational knowledge or context for the current study.  
**Uses (1):** Current work employs the cited work's method, data, tool, or concept directly.  
**Compare/Contrast (2):** Current work discusses similarities or differences with the cited work.  
**Motivation (3):** Cited work highlights a problem/gap that the current study addresses.  
**Continuation/Extends (4):** Current work builds upon, refines, or advances the cited work.  
**Future (5):** Citation suggests directions inspired by the cited work.
