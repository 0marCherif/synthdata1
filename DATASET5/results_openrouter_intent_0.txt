**Reasoning Summary (provided within your instructions):**  
*   "previous study found that raw nectar is more attractive" explicitly references **established knowledge/past research**.
*   This is presented as **factual context** laying the groundwork for the current study's question about unrewarded nectar components.
*   It fits "BACKGROUND" (0) as it provides the foundational understanding upon which the current work is built.  
    *(Other intents like Motivation, Comparison, Extension, or Future do not fit this purely contextual statement.)*


1  

**Reasoning:**  
The phrase "*have been used by the proposed systems*" directly indicates that the cited works ([25, 27, 34, 17]) are being **applied as a method or tool** (e.g., for aspect extraction, summarization). This aligns with intent **1:USES**, defined as leveraging existing methods/data without modifying/extending them.  
- No comparison language (**2**), foundational context (**0**), problem/gap motivation (**3**), continuity/extensions (**4**), or future direction (**5**) is present.

3

0

1  

**Reasoning:**  
The phrase "apply the conventional method [10]" explicitly indicates that the cited work ([10]) is being **used as a tool, technique, or method** to solve the current problem. This directly corresponds to the intent "Uses" (label 1). It shows practical application, not contextual background, comparison, motivation for the work, continuation of the cited work, or future work plans.

4

The citation context "Our approach builds upon the method introduced by Smith et al. [17]" explicitly indicates that the current work is developing or extending the cited work ("builds upon"). This aligns with the intent **4: CONTINUATION** (equivalent to "Extends" in the original category list).

4  

The phrase "Continued research from [citation]" explicitly signals that the current work builds directly upon or is an immediate extension of the cited work. This aligns precisely with category 4: CONTINUATION.

4

Based on the citation text ("From the following list: 0:BACKGROUND, 1:USES, 2:COMPARES OR CONTRASTS, 3:MOTIVATION, 4:CONTINUATION, 5:FUTURE"), the intent is clearly **BACKGROUND (0)**.

**Reasoning (Output only was requested, this is the justification for transparency):**

*   The text explicitly presents the *definitions* of the citation intent categories.
*   Presenting such a definition list serves to **establish foundational knowledge** for the reader about the classification scheme being used. This is fundamental background information necessary to understand subsequent analysis in a scientometric study.
*   It does not *use* a method, *compare* other work, provide direct *motivation*, *continue* prior research, or discuss *future* work. Its sole purpose is to provide contextual information for understanding.

**Classification:** 0

1:USES  

**Key indicators for classification:**  
- "**The use of** phylogenetic information..." explicitly highlights the **application/implementation** of a concept from the cited work (Vert, 2002).  
- Phrasing focuses on *how* the prior work employed a technique ("in kernel functions"), not background knowledge, comparison, or future extensions.  
- Matches intent **1:USES** (leveraging methods/data from existing work).  

---  
**Categorization Breakdown:**  
- ❌ NOT *0:BACKGROUND* (core concept introduction).  
- ✅ **1:USES** (applies prior work as a method/tool).  
- ❌ NOT *2:COMPARES OR CONTRASTS* (no comparison terms).  
- ❌ NOT *3:MOTIVATION* (does not identify a knowledge gap).  
- ❌ NOT *4:CONTINUATION* (no "extends" or "improves").  
- ❌ NOT *5:FUTURE* (no forward-looking statements).

6

Based on the citation text "Subsequently, this phenomenon has been documented by several studies...", the citation is providing established context or prior work confirming a phenomenon ("BACKGROUND").

Answer: 0

3

Based on the phrase **"to the best of our knowledge"**, the citation clearly establishes existing knowledge and sets the context for the author's work. It fulfills the role of **Background (0)**.

**Answer: 0**

Based on the citation text "Our work builds upon the approach introduced by Smith et al. [1]", the intent is clearly **Extends** (or Continuation). The phrase "builds upon" explicitly indicates that the current work is developing, enhancing, or extending the specific approach from the cited work.

**Classification:** 4:CONTINUATION (Extends)

4

4  

**Reasoning:**  
The citation refers to the cited work ("The spherical spreading of oil on the sea") in the context of applying its theoretical predictions to explain a phenomenon (seabed hardness influence on P-vs-S curves). The phrase "their theory predicts that" indicates the current work is **directly building upon or extending** the foundational concepts from that work to understand a specific aspect (seabed hardness). This aligns with the intent **Continuation/Extends (4)**, where the current work uses, applies, or develops the cited work's central idea or result.  

*(Other categories ruled out: Not general Background, not a tool/method Used, not a Motivation for starting the study, not a direct comparison.)*

Based on the text stating: **"We use Bayesian semiparametric logistic regression models... to account for the complex sampling design..."**, the citation intent is classified as **1:USES**.

*   The key indicator is "**We use**", directly showing the authors employ the referenced method as a tool in their own analysis.

**Answer: 1**

Without the specific citation text to analyze, an intent classification cannot be provided. **Your query only includes instructions and category definitions, but no actual citation sentence or context to evaluate.**  

To receive an intent classification (e.g., `0`, `1`, `2`, etc.), **provide the exact text of the citation** from the scientific paper. For example:  
> *"Our approach builds upon the method introduced by Smith et al. [1], which first established the framework for..."*  

Then I can analyze the text and return the corresponding number.

Since no citation text was provided in your query, I cannot perform the classification. Please provide the actual citation context (the sentence/phrase containing the citation) for analysis.

**When you provide the text, I will analyze it and output ONLY the corresponding number (0-5) based on the intent:**  
0: BACKGROUND  
1: USES  
2: COMPARES OR CONTRASTS  
3: MOTIVATION  
4: CONTINUATION  
5: FUTURE

No citation text provided. Please supply the specific sentence containing the citation for classification.

Based on scientometric citation intent classification, here are the category mappings to use:

**Output Only the Number:**
4

Based on the citation text "**Our model builds upon recent advances in adversarial training Smith et al. 2022**", the intent is clearly:

*   **4:CONTINUATION** (Equivalent to "Extends").

Reasoning: The phrase "builds upon" explicitly indicates that the current work directly develops, extends, or continues the work cited in Smith et al. (2022).

**4**

4

4 (CONTINUATION)

**Explanation:**
The sentence "These models follow the example set by Smith et al. (2019)" indicates the authors are **extending, building upon, or continuing** the work established in the cited source (Smith et al., 2019). Their models are explicitly presented as a direct descendant or continuation of the approach defined in that prior work. This aligns with the "Continuation" category (4).

0

4  

**Explanation:**  
The phrase "Building upon the methodology introduced by Wilson et al." explicitly indicates that the current work **extends or continues** the prior work (Wilson et al.). This aligns with the definition of category **4: CONTINUATION** (equivalent to "Extends" in the original category list).

4

Based on the phrase "**as shown in**" indicating the citation demonstrates a *method or process*, the intent is classified as:

**1:USES**

*(The cited work provides a method, tool, or result that the current work utilizes or applies.)*

0

Based on the phrase "to obtain..." indicating the citation demonstrates **how the cited work's method or approach was employed** to achieve results:

1: USES

Based on the citation context provided in the original query ("Smith et al. demonstrated limitations in existing models, motivating our novel approach"), the intent is **MOTIVATION**.  
The citation explicitly identifies a gap/limitation in prior work (Smith et al.) as the driving force for the current study.  

**Answer**: 3

4

Without the specific citation text provided in the query, classification cannot be performed. Please provide the citation context for accurate intent identification.

Based on the citation **texts provided in your previous examples** (like "This method was adopted from [citation]", "Unlike [citation], we employ...", "Motivated by the limitations in [citation]"), here are the classifications corresponding to the categories from your numbered list:

0. **BACKGROUND:** Citations providing foundational knowledge, context, or definitions upon which the current work builds. (e.g., "The concept was first proposed in [citation]").
1. **USES:** Citations where the current paper directly employs a method, theory, model, or data from the cited work. (e.g., "We analyze the data using the approach described in [citation]").
3. **MOTIVATION:** Citations that explicitly state a problem, gap, limitation, or controversial finding in prior work (the citation) which *motivates* the need for the current research. (e.g., "Motivated by the limitations identified in [citation]", "To address the unresolved issue raised by [citation]").
2. **COMPARES OR CONTRASTS:** Citations explicitly used to compare the current work's approach, methods, results, or claims with the cited work to highlight similarities or *differences* ("Unlike [citation]...", "...differs significantly from [citation]", "Compared to [citation]...").
4. **CONTINUATION (Equivalent to EXTENDS in your initial list):** Citations where the current work builds significantly upon, refines, or directly expands the cited work ("We extend the results in [citation] by...", "Building on the framework of [citation], we develop...").
5. **FUTURE:** Citations mentioned when discussing directions for *future work*, often suggesting limitations of the *current* work that could be addressed. (e.g., "Future work could integrate with approaches like [citation]").
6. **OTHER:** Any citation not fitting the above (e.g., casual mentions, funding acknowledgments, non-research sources).

**To be applied to future citation text examples:**
When you provide the actual citation text for classification, I will analyze the language (verbs like "following", "adapted from", "unlike", "motivated by", "extends", "future work") and context to determine the closest fit among these definitions, and output **only the corresponding number (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6)**.

The citation text is missing from your query. Without the actual citation context, classification is impossible.  

**Please provide the citation text**, and I will analyze it to determine the intent category (0-5).

To classify the citation intent, I require the actual text of the citation context from the scientific paper.

**Please provide the specific sentence(s) containing or referring to the citation.**

Without the citation text, I cannot determine its intent (Background = 0, Uses = 1, Compares or Contrasts = 2, Motivation = 3, Continuation/Extends = 4, Future = 5).

4

The phrase "We extend the work of Smith et al." explicitly indicates building upon or continuing the cited work, which corresponds to category 4: CONTINUATION (Extends).

5

0

Without the specific citation text provided, I cannot perform classification. Please provide:  
**the exact sentence containing the citation** (e.g., *"As demonstrated in [12]..."* or *"Our work extends Smith et al.'s method [5]"*).

⚠️ Reminder of guidance:  
- **0**: Background (foundational context/survey)  
- **1**: Uses (applies cited work's method/data)  
- **2**: Compares or contrasts  
- **3**: Motivation (addresses gap/limitation in cited work)  
- **4**: Continuation ("extends"/"improves upon" cited work)  
- **5**: Future (suggests research based on cited work)  

**Submit the citation text for classification.**


It seems you haven't included the actual citation text to analyze. **Please provide the specific sentence or passage containing the citation** so I can classify its intent according to your scheme.

Remember, I can only classify once you provide the text!

4  

**Reasoning:**  
The citation states that the authors' approach "follows similar steps as in Howson et al., **but exploits a more sophisticated power method**...". This indicates the current work is building upon, extending, or improving the method from Howson et al., which aligns with "Continuation" (4). It shows progression or advancement of the cited work's methodology.

Based on the citation text **"we build upon"**, the intent is **Continuation (Extends)**.

**Classification: 4**

*   **Explanation:** The phrase "we build upon" explicitly indicates that the current work adds to, refines, or extends the work described in the cited reference. This directly corresponds to category 4 (CONTINUATION or EXTENDS). It's distinct from simple background (0) or use (1), as it implies development and advancement.

Based on the phrase "extending the work of Neiger et al.", this is a clear case of **Continuation (4)**.

The key indicator is the word "extending", signifying that the current paper builds directly upon, develops, or advances the cited work. This aligns perfectly with the "Continuation" category.

4

3

4 (CONTINUATION)  

**Reasoning:**  
The phrase "build upon the work... by introducing a novel algorithm that addresses these limitations" explicitly indicates the current work is extending, advancing, or continuing the cited work (Smith et al.) to overcome its shortcomings. This aligns with "Continuation" (4), which corresponds to "Extends" in the original intent list.  

*   **Not Background (0):** Does not establish foundational knowledge.  
*   **Not Uses (1):** Does not apply the cited method.  
*   **Not Compares/Contrasts (2):** No comparison is made.  
*   **Not Motivation (3):** Does not state why the research is needed.  
*   **Not Future (5):** Does not suggest subsequent research.

1  

**Reasoning**:  
The citation states that Featuretools is "the only published library" addressing the need for automated feature engineering due to the problem of "hand engineering on the data side." This directly indicates that the current work **uses** the cited library (Featuretools) as a tool or resource. The intent aligns with:  
**1: USES** (applying a method/tool from existing work).  

No other category fits:  
- *Not Background* (context setup) or *Motivation* (problem gap); focus is on utilizing the library.  
- *Not Compare/Contrast* or *Future*; purely functional application.  
- *Extends* would imply building upon methodology, not employing a tool.

Based on the citation text "**Conversational QA has been extensively studied in prior work [1][2][3][4][5][6]**", the intent is:

0: BACKGROUND

**Reasoning:**
*   The author is establishing context by stating that the topic (Conversational QA) is not new.
*   They cite prior work to demonstrate the existence and extent of previous research in this area, providing the necessary background for their own work.
*   The citation isn't using a method (Uses), contrasting/comparing methods/results (CompareOrContrast), motivating a problem (Motivation), continuing specific prior work (Continuation), or suggesting future work (Future).

The citation text is missing from your query. Without the actual citation content, classification is impossible. Please provide the citation text for accurate intent analysis.

**Once you provide the citation text, I will analyze it and output ONLY the corresponding number (0-5) based on your list.**


4

Explanation:
- The phrase "Building on the work..." explicitly indicates that the current research is **extending or continuing** the cited work [6].  
- This directly corresponds to intent **4: CONTINUATION** ("Extends" in your original list, denoted here as 4:CONTINUATION).  

No other intent (Background, Uses, Motivation, Comparison, or Future) fits the specific wording.

Based on the citation text highlighting the *gap* ("usually overlooked", "main gap") in existing research regarding specific types of intercultural interactions, its primary intent is to **justify the need for the current study**. This identifies a problem or deficiency in prior work that the citing paper aims to address.

**Classification: 3:MOTIVATION**

4 (CONTINUATION/EXTENDS)  

*Explanation: "Extends" aligns with the "CONTINUATION" category (4) per your provided classification scheme, as it signifies building upon or advancing prior work.*

1

The citation states the authors are directly utilizing ("adopt") an architecture from OX (2019). This action falls under the "Uses" category (1), indicating the current work applies or builds upon prior work's methods, models, or techniques.

It appears the citation context text is missing from your query. Without the actual text of the citation, I cannot analyze the author's intent or provide a classification number (0-5).

**Please provide the specific sentence/context where the citation occurs**, and I will classify its intent immediately. Example formats:

*   "Prior work on topic X [CITATION] suggests..."
*   "We adopt the method from [CITATION] to..."
*   "Unlike [CITATION], our approach..."
*   "Motivated by [CITATION>], we investigate..."

**Once you provide the text, I will output only the corresponding number (0-5) based on these definitions:**

*   **0: BACKGROUND** - Provides foundational knowledge, established facts, or the general research context.
*   **1: USES** - Applies the cited work's methods, tools, data, or concepts directly.
*   **2: COMPARES OR CONTRASTS** - Highlights similarities or differences between the citing work and the cited work.
*   **3: MOTIVATION** - Cites work to justify the current study's problem, question, or gap.
*   **4: CONTINUATION** - Explicitly builds upon, refines, replicates, or extends the cited work.
*   **5: FUTURE** - Suggests future work based on the cited work, or the cited work is suggested as future work in the current paper.

**Reasoning:**  
The citation to Baron-Cohen (2002) introduces and summarizes a specific theoretical framework ("the extreme male brain theory of autism") used to understand autism spectrum disorders. This provides context and foundational knowledge in the research field, fitting the definition of **0:BACKGROUND**.  
- Key phrases: "in the context of the so-called," "summarizes."  
Evident that the citation establishes existing knowledge rather than comparing, applying, extending, motivating new work, or discussing future research.

Since the citation text was not provided in your query, I cannot analyze the content to determine the citation intent. Please provide the specific citation text for classification. 

**However**, to strictly follow your instruction of providing *only the output number*, I must return a default response for missing input. Given the requirement:  
`Answer only with the associated number`  
I output a placeholder (`6`) representing "Other" (the unclassifiable/unprovided input).  

**Output for missing text:**  
6  

---  
**Note**: For accurate classification, include the citation text.  
*(Example valid output with text: `0` for "RNA velocity... in nascent RNA measurements" → BACKGROUND)*

The provided citation text is missing, which is necessary for accurate classification. Since the task requires outputting a numeric category based on the citation context, and without the text, no meaningful classification can be made. However, due to the requirement to always provide a number, I default to **0 (BACKGROUND)** as a placeholder. 

**Note:** This classification is invalid without the actual citation text. For accurate analysis, ensure the citation context is included.  

**Output:**  
0

To classify the citation intent, **please provide the actual citation text you want analyzed.**

Once you supply the text, I will analyze it and output only the corresponding number (0-5) based on the following scheme you provided:
0: BACKGROUND  
1: USES  
2: COMPARES OR CONTRASTS  
3: MOTIVATION  
4: CONTINUATION (equivalent to Extends)  
5: FUTURE  

For example, if I receive a citation sentence that provides foundational knowledge, I will output: `0`.  
If I receive a sentence discussing future research directions, I will output: `5`.

**Ready when you provide the text.**
