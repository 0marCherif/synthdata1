Based on the citation context:  
- The phrase "has been shown previously" directly references prior work by Weeds and Weir (2005) to establish existing knowledge in the domain.  
- It provides foundational context for the current paper's topic ("tuning similarity to the application of interest"), typical of a **Background** citation.  
- No elements indicate usage, extension, comparison, motivation, or future work (e.g., "our method builds on...", "unlike...", "to address this gap...").

**Answer: 0**

The citation intent is classified as **3: MOTIVATION**.  
The author cites these works (Chafe 1979, Halliday and Hasan 1976, etc.) to identify a limitation ("a certain limitation in their formal techniques"), highlighting a gap in existing research. This critique explicitly establishes the *need* for the current studyâ€™s approach or contributions, aligning with MOTIVATION's purpose of illustrating a research gap or necessity.  

Key clues:  
- "Although...all of them share a certain limitation...": Frameworks the cited works as insufficient.  
- Exposes a methodological shortcoming to justify the current work's objectives.

The citation lists multiple parsers to present their results alongside the author's model, clearly indicating a **comparison** of different approaches and their outputs. This matches option 2: COMPARES OR CONTRASTS.

Based on the citation context:  
- The sentence describes encoding a rule "**in terms of the setup of**" Pollard and Sag (1994).  
- This indicates the current work is **building upon**, reformulating, or adapting the framework established in the cited work.  
- The phrase "in terms of the setup of" explicitly signals **extension or adaptation** of the cited methodology.  

**Classification:** CONTINUATION (extends the citation's methods/framework).

The citation of Kiefer et al. (1999) contrasts the authors' approach with prior findings, explicitly stating their method is "**at variance**" with Kiefer et al.'s results. This highlights a **difference in methodologies or outcomes**, aligning with the "COMPARES OR CONTRASTS" intent.

Answer: 2

The citation "(Mehdad et al., 2010)" is used to show that the authors' results **align with or support** the findings from the cited paper. The phrase "in line with the findings" explicitly indicates a **direct comparison** between the current results and prior work. 

This fits the **COMPARES OR CONTRASTS** intent (2), as it highlights similarity without introducing background, methodology usage, motivation, extension, or future work.

Explanation: The phrase "lexical generalizations are captured using lexical underspecification (Kathol 1994; Krieger and Nerbonne 1992)" indicates the current work is directly applying a specific method (lexical underspecification) from these cited sources. This aligns with the "USES" category (using methods from the citation). The other intents don't fit: it isn't providing background generally, motivating the research, extending the prior work, comparing it, or proposing future work.


Based on the context and phrasing, the citation:

"The bottom panel of table 1 lists the results for the chosen lexicalized model (...) and **five recent statistical parsers (Ratnaparkhi, 1999; Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000; Collins, 2000; Bod, 2001)**."

is **listing existing work (the statistical parsers) as part of the established research landscape relevant to the current domain and experiment** (comparing results in a table). It provides context for the domain and the basis for the comparison. The author isn't *using* those parsers, *extending* them, *comparing* them directly *to each other* in this sentence, *motivating* their work based on them, or stating they are *future work*. They are simply citing relevant background knowledge.

Therefore, the intent is **0:BACKGROUND**.

ANSWER: 0

1  
// The citation intent is "USES":  
// The sentence describes how Macklovitch & Hannan (1996) actively **applied** Brown et al.'s Model 2 (a specific method) to evaluate link tokens.  
// Key indicators: "trained Brown et al.'s Model 2" explicitly shows utilization of a method from the cited work.  
// No other intent applies:  
// - Not BACKGROUND (not general domain context).  
// - Not MOTIVATION (not illustrating a need).  
// - Not FUTURE/CONTINUATION (not future work or extensions).  
// - No comparison language.

The citation highlights a limitation ("no formal evaluation was performed") in prior work (Lapalme and Kosseim 2003; Roy and Subramaniam 2006), illustrating a methodological gap that motivates the current study's approach. This aligns with the **MOTIVATION** category (number 3), as it explicitly shows the need for improved methods or data.

The citation is used to **contrast** the performance of Turkish (as reported by Oflazer et al., 2003 and Atalay et al., 2003) with another subject. Key indicators:  
- The phrase "By contrast" explicitly signals a comparison.  
- The sentence highlights differences (high root accuracy vs. low attachment scores) between Turkish and the implied baseline/subject.  
- Specifies metrics (88% and 68%) to quantify the contrast, further emphasizing analytical comparison.  

This intent aligns with **2: COMPARES OR CONTRASTS**.
