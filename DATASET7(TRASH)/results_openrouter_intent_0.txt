The citation serves as **BACKGROUND** by:
- Providing foundational references (Wiebe & Rapaport, Hearst, Sack) to establish the history of sentiment analysis
- Mentioning a key survey (Esuli) to contextualize the research domain  
- Framing sentiment analysis as an established field without extending or contrasting methods

*Answer: 0 (BACKGROUND)*

0

0

Explanation:
The citation context describes historical developments ("over the past few years", "advances", "progress has been made") and lists foundational works in statistical parsing (full parsers and shallow parsing). This establishes the research background and existing state-of-the-art in the field, which is the defining characteristic of "Background" (Option 0). The citations are not being used for their methods/data (Uses), extended (Continuation), motivated by a gap (Motivation), compared/contrasted (Compares/Contrasts), or suggested for future work (Future).

Based on the context provided, the citation cluster (Andrews et al., 2009; Steyvers, 2010; etc.) serves to:

1.  **Establish Context:** The sentence introduces "Another line of research," describing a specific approach ("augmenting distributional approaches... with perceptual information") within the field.
2.  **Describe Existing Work:** It summarizes what other researchers have done, listing several examples.
3.  **No Active Interaction:** There's no indication the current paper *uses* the specific data/methods from these papers, *extends* them, *compares directly* to them, identifies a gap *motivating* this specific work, or proposes to *build on them in the future*.
4.  **Positioning:** This is classic background information, setting the stage by outlining relevant prior approaches before likely introducing the current work.

**Intent: Background (Category 0)**

0

1:USES

Explanation: The citation states that Gurevych (2005) "replicated the experiment" from the cited work (Rubenstein and Goodenough), explicitly indicating that their methods or approach were reused. This aligns with the "USES" intent (using methods from the citation). The category numbers are:
- **1:USES**: "to use data, methods, etc from the citation."  
Replication falls squarely under utilizing existing methods. Other intents (e.g., Background, Continuation) are not supported here.

1  
The citation (Evermann et al., 2004) demonstrates the successful application of tools (like LDA) in speech recognition, which the authors explicitly leverage ("allows us to leverage") for their own work. This aligns with **USES** (using methods/data from the citation).  

**Reasoning breakdown:**  
- The phrase "leverage a variety of tools... that have been shown to be successful" indicates adoption of existing methods.  
- The citation serves as proof of efficacy in another field (speech recognition), justifying its use here.  
- No extension, comparison, or future intent is present.

The citation serves to provide foundational terminology for discussing "opposition," citing Halliday & Hasan's definition and referencing Quirk et al. for additional support. This is classic BACKGROUND citation, establishing domain knowledge and definitions. The use of "cf." ("confer") refers readers to related works for context, not for comparison or methodological use. Thus, the intent aligns with category 0: BACKGROUND.

Based on the citation context and the definitions provided:

1.  **The text states:** "The language grounding problem has received significant attention in recent years, **owed in part to** the wide availability of data sets (e.g. Flickr, Von Ahn (2006)), computing power, improved computer vision models (Oliva and Torralba, 2001; Lowe, 2004; Farhadi et al., 2009; Parikh and Grauman, 2011) and neurological evidence (Pulverm√ºller et al., 2005; Tettamanti et al., 2005; Aziz-Zadeh et al., 2006)."
2.  **Analysis:** The citations listed (Von Ahn (2006), Oliva and Torralba (2001), etc.) are not being *used* as part of the current work's methodology, *extended*, *compared*, used to *motivate* a specific gap the current work fills, or proposed for *future* work. Instead, they are cited as **evidence** or **examples** representing the factors (datasets, models, evidence) that have contributed to the increased attention to the language grounding problem. This provides context and foundational information about the state of the field, which is the defining characteristic of "Background".
3.  **Classification:** BACKGROUND is defined as "to provide relevant information for this domain". This perfectly matches the use of the citations in this sentence.

**Reasoning:**  
The citation lists foundational works (Dowty 1979, Jackendoff 1983, etc.) to establish a widely accepted theoretical basis ("general consensus") within the field of linguistics regarding event structure. It provides essential background knowledge and context for the paper's domain, framing the existing understanding of verbal argument representation before the author presents their own work. It does not describe using, extending, comparing, or motivating specific methods/data from these sources, nor does it suggest future work.

**Key Indicators:**  
- "There is a general consensus among theoretical linguists..."  
- Cites seminal literature establishing the core theory.  
- Grounds the paper's subject in established prior research.

The citation is providing historical context and established terminology in the field ("The names given to the components vary... they have been called..."). It cites prior works to establish what is already known about naming conventions for these components, fitting the definition of BACKGROUND. The author is not extending, using, contrasting, motivating with, or proposing future work based on these citations.

The citation provides evidence for the *reason* behind recent work ("because..."), demonstrating a need (established correlation between student talk and learning) that motivates current research. This aligns with MOTIVATION.

**Reasoning Breakdown:**
1.  **Structure:** The sentence links the current interest ("interest in developing...") directly to background knowledge ("because high percentages... are *known* to be correlated...").
2.  **Role of Citation:** The cited works (Chi et al., 1994, Litman et al., 2009, etc.) provide foundational evidence *showing* that student contentful talk correlates with learning, thereby "illustrating the need" (MOTIVATION) for the current work on understanding student explanations in dialogue systems.
3.  **Not Background:** While the content *is* background knowledge, the use of "because" explicitly frames it as the reason/motivation. Background would set a general scene without necessarily giving the cause ("Over the last decade... systems understand student explanations. [Citation] showed student talk correlates with learning" vs. the given "...systems... *because* [Citation] showed...").
4.  **Not Others:** It doesn't use data/method (USES), extend them (CONTINUATION), compare (COMPARES), or propose future work (FUTURE).

1  
(USES)  

**Explanation:**  
The citation directly references applying an existing method ("pruning techniques") to the current work, aligning with the intent of **using** data, methods, or tools from the cited source to achieve a goal (increase precision). There is no indication of extension, comparison, motivation, or future work.

The citation indicates that GATE builds upon Cunningham's component-based infrastructure (2000) to create a more advanced system ("goes beyond earlier systems"). This demonstrates extension of the cited work's methods/infrastructure, classifying it as CONTINUATION.

Based on the citation text:

> "Perlis (1985) describes how first order logic can be augmented with such an operator."

*   The author is **citing Perlis (1985) to provide information** about augmenting first-order logic with a quotation operator.
*   This information serves as **foundational knowledge or context** for the domain being discussed (the need for/reference to quotation within logic).
*   The citation does not indicate the author is using Perlis's method, extending it, motivated by a problem it identifies, comparing/contrasting with it, or suggesting future work building upon it.
*   Its primary purpose is **to provide relevant foundational information** about the subject matter.

The key phrase "how these results compare to the results" explicitly signals a comparison objective, and "not yet discussed" indicates this comparison is pending in their work. This falls under **Category 2: COMPARES OR CONTRASTS** as it directly addresses evaluating similarities/differences between the authors' methods (G2 and Fisher's test) and the MI measure technique from Church and Hanks (1990). The intent is analytical juxtaposition, not establishing background, using methods, or motivating further research.


0  
The citation supplies established domain knowledge about a negative impact of morphological variants in IR, serving as foundational context for the paper's discussion.  
**Classification Reasoning:**  
- The sentence states a well-known problem ("*negative impact on recall*") supported by citations.  
- Citations (Choueka et al.) provide evidence for a *domain challenge*, not a method, contrast, or future direction.  
- This intent aligns with **BACKGROUND (0)**: citing prior work to frame the problem space.  

No evidence for other intents:  
- Not **USES** (doesn't adopt cited methods/data).  
- Not **MOTIVATION** (problem is stated, not justifying the current study's goals).  
- Not **COMPARES/CONTRASTS** or **FUTURE**.

Based on the analysis:

*   The sentence cites Bing (1985) for their prior work examining the relationship between discourse and prosodic phrasing.
*   It specifically outlines Bing's argument (each NP is a separate prosodic phrase unless destressed due to discourse reference).
*   The citation serves to establish what is already known about the topic, providing foundational knowledge relevant to the paper's domain.
*   This directly corresponds to the **BACKGROUND** intent (0): "to provide relevant information for this domain".

Based on the citation text:
"existing treatments of gradables in GRE **fail to take** the `` efficiency of language '' into account ( Barwise and Perry 1983 ; see our Section 2 )"

The author is **explicitly identifying a limitation or deficiency** (they "fail to take... into account") in the cited work by Barwise and Perry. This establishes a **contrast** between what the cited work does *not* address and the focus of the current paper (presumably on the "efficiency of language"). The phrase "see our Section 2" strongly implies the author's own work *does* address this gap in contrast to the cited work.

**This is a clear expression of difference with the cited work, fitting the COMPARES OR CONTRASTS category.**
